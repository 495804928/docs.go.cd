3.1 Setting up your development environment 
--------------------------------------------



### 3.1.1 Using vagrant to bring up the Go Development environment

### 3.1.2 Setting it up manually



Go requires the following software packages to build

-   JDK 6+ (OpenJDK or Oracle)

-   *Ruby (1.8+)*

-   Ruby sass gem (3.2.5+)

-   Git (1.7+)



Assuming the codebase is cloned into **~/projects/go**, you need to execute the
following commands to build Go

>   **~/projects/go$** unset GEM_HOME

>   **~/projects/go$** unset GEM_PATH

>   **~/projects/go$** ./tools/jruby/bin/jruby -J-Xmx2048m -S buildr clean dist
>   ALLOW_NON_PRODUCTION_CODE=yes



The above set of commands are captured as part of an executable file named
"**b**" at the root of the project. In order to achieve the output same as the
above set of commands, you could optionally choose to run

>   **~/projects/go$** ./b clean dist ALLOW\\_NON\\_PRODUCTION\\_CODE=yes



After a successful build, the build artifacts are generated inside a directory
named "**target**" in the working directory. The output directory contains JARs
along with the packaged ZIP installer for Go Server and Go Agent.

>   **~/projects/go$** ls target

>   agent

>   agent-bootstrapper

>   ...

>   **go-agent-14.1.0**

>   **go-server-14.1.0**

>   ...

>   util
