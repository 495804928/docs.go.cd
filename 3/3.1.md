# 3.1 Setting up your development environment 

## 3.1.1 Using vagrant to bring up the Go Development environment

> Supported versions: Vagrant **1.4.3+**, VirtualBox **4.3.6+**

Clone the repository holding the vagrant scripts from 

```
~/projects$ git clone https://github.com/GoCD/go-development-environment-setup.git
~/projects$ cd go-development-environment-setup
```

### Setting up a minimal Go Development Environment

```
~/projects/go-development-environment-setup$ ./setup.sh
```

### Setting up a Gnome based Go Development Environment

```
~/projects/go-development-environment-setup$ ./setup.gui.sh
```

Once the box is provisioned, you can bring up the box by running

```
~/projects/go-development-environment-setup$ vagrant up
```

Note: Network IO might be slow when configured to use NAT (default). You could change it to 'Bridged' mode to improve performance. In this mode, it necessitates that a network interface is chosen upon boot. Add the line below in the Vagrantfile to enable 'Bridged' mode:

```
config.vm.network :public_network
```


## 3.1.2 Setting it up manually

Go requires the following software packages to build

-   JDK 6+ (OpenJDK or Oracle)
-   Ruby (1.8+)
-   Ruby sass gem (3.2.5+)
-   Git (1.7+)
-   Maven (3.1.1+)

Assuming the codebase is cloned into **~/projects/go**, you need to execute the
following commands to build Go

```
~/projects/go$ unset GEM_HOME
~/projects/go$ unset GEM_PATH
~/projects/go$ ./tools/jruby/bin/jruby -J-Xmx2048m -S buildr clean cruise:prepare dist
```

The above set of commands are captured as part of an executable file named
"**b**" at the root of the project. In order to achieve the output same as the
above set of commands, you could optionally choose to run

```
~/projects/go$ ./b clean cruise:prepare dist
```

After a successful build, the build artifacts are generated inside a directory
named "**target**" in the working directory. The output directory contains JARs
along with the packaged ZIP installer for Go Server and Go Agent.

```
~/projects/go$ ls target
agent
agent-bootstrapper
...
go-agent-14.1.0
go-server-14.1.0
...
util

```

## 3.1.3 Building via IntelliJ IDEA

If you have IntelliJ IDEA configured, you could optionally use it to build Go. 

Prior to build via the IDE, we would have to prepare the working directory with copying the database deltas to the configured location. You can achive this by runnning the below command in the working directory.

```
~/projects/go$ ./b clean
~/projects/go$ ./bn cruise:prepare
```

After the preparation phase has succeeded, 

- Open the project in IDEA
- Build -> Rebuild project

## 3.1.4 Running Development Server via IntelliJ IDEA

When developing using IntelliJ IDEA, it is always convenient to run the Go Server in *development mode*. Apart from the convenience, you also get

- Live debugging
- Faster feedback
- Hotswapping changes while the JVM is up

The IDEA **Application** run-configuration can be setup using the values below:

```
Name: Development Server - H2
Main Class: com.thoughtworks.cruise.server.DevelopmentServer
VM options: -XX:MaxPermSize=128m
Working directory: <project-directory>/server
Use classpath of module: development-utilities
```
