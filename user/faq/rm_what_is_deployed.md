# Discover what's in an environment

Before [deploying something into production](rm_deploy_to_environment.md), it is often useful to know what is currently there.

### Example usage

For this example, we will assume we have a stage name "production" that will automatically deploy a binary onto a production server

-   Start at the [Environments](../navigations/environments_page.md) page

-   The [Stage Details](../navigations/stage_details_page.md) page will show every time Go has deployed your application
