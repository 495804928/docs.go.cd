Discover what's in an environment {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}
=================================

Before [deploying something into
production](rm_deploy_to_environment.html), it is often useful to know
what is currently there.

### Example usage {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

For this example, we will assume we have a stage name "production" that
will automatically deploy a binary onto a production server

-   Start at the [Environments](../navigations/environments_page.html) page
-   ![](../resources/images/cruise/topnav_environments.png)
-   Click on the name of your "production" stage
-   ![](../resources/images/cruise/release_manager/whats_in_an_environment/2_click_stage_activity.png)
-   The [Stage Details](../navigations/stage_details_page.html) page will show every
    time Go has deployed your application
