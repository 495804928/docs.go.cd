=========================

After [uploading html reports](dev_upload_test_report.html), it is often
useful to be able to easily view this information when trying to
[understand why the build is
broken](dev_understand_why_build_broken.html).

### Example usage {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   Suppose we have configured Go to [upload a flash video and html file
    and display it as a tab](dev_upload_test_report.html)
-   Click on the [Pipelines](Pipelines_Dashboard_page.html) tab
-   ![](../resources/images/cruise/topnav_pipelines.png)
-   Click on the stage you want to investigate
-   ![](../resources/images/cruise/dev/see_artifact_as_tab/click_on_stage.png)
-   Click on the job you want to investigate
-   ![](../resources/images/cruise/dev/see_artifact_as_tab/2_click_job_with_tab.png)
-   Click on the tab you created
-   ![](../resources/images/cruise/dev/see_artifact_as_tab/3_click_my_subtab.png)
-   Clicking on the tab will load the page, which will start the video!
