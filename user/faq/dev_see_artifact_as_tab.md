# See artifacts as sub-tabs

After [uploading html reports](../configuration/dev_upload_test_report.md), it is often useful to be able to easily view this information when trying to [understand why the build is broken](dev_understand_why_build_broken.md).

### Example usage

-   Suppose we have configured Go to [upload a flash video and html file and display it as a tab](../configuration/dev_upload_test_report.md)
-   Click on the [Pipelines](../navigation/Pipelines_Dashboard_page.md) tab
