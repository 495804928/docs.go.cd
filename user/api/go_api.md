# Go API

## Introduction

RESTful APIs offer a convenient way to integrate networked systems. Go provides a RESTful API through which you can access and manipulate various kinds of resources. The following sections will walk you through the various resources and the operations that are supported on each of them.

### Go API features

The Go API provides access to various kinds of resources in Go over HTTP. The standard HTTP operation of GET, POST and PUT and DELETE are used to support read, create and upload operations on them. All Go APIs use HTTP basic authentication. Hence performing a GET operation for Artifacts would be the equivalent of getting that resource, performing a PUT would be the equivalent of updating that artifact; and so on.

### Main APIs

The Go API documented here is a work in progress. Future versions may change this API.

Go's main APIs are listed below:

-   [Pipeline Group API](pipeline_group_api.md)
-   [Pipeline API](pipeline_api.md)
-   [Stages API](stages_api.md)
-   [Job API](job_api.md)
-   [Agent API](agent_api.md)
-   [Materials API](materials_api.md)
-   [Configuration API](configuration_api.md)
-   [Artifacts API](artifacts_api.md)
-   [Users API](users_api.md)
-   [Backup API](backup_api.md)
-   [Properties API](properties_api.md)
-   [Feeds API](feeds_api.md)
-   [Command Repo API](command_repo_api.md)
