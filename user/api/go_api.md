======

### Introduction {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

RESTful APIs offer a convenient way to integrate networked systems. Go
provides a RESTful API through which you can access and manipulate
various kinds of resources. Artifacts, Properties and configurations are
the kinds of resources that are available in this version of the API.
The following sections will walk you through the various resources and
the operations that are supported on each of them.

#### Go API features {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

The Go API provides access to various kinds of resources in Go over
HTTP. The standard HTTP operation of GET, POST and PUT and DELETE are
used to support read, create and upload operations on them. All Go APIs
use HTTP basic authentication. Hence performing a GET operation for
Artifacts would be the equivalent of getting that resource, performing a
PUT would be the equivalent of updating that artifact; and so on.

#### Main APIs {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

The Go API documented here is a work in progress. Future versions may
change this API.

Go's main APIs are listed below:

-   [Artifacts API](Artifacts_API.html)
-   [Properties API](../advanced_usage/Properties_API.html)
-   [Configuration API](Configuration_API.html)
-   [Pipeline API](Pipeline_API.html)
-   [Stages API](Stages_API.html)
-   [Command Repo API](command_repo_api.html)
-   [Agent API](Agent_API.html)
-   [Backup API](Backup_API.html)
-   [Users API](users_api.html)
