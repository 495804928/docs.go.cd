General reasons for auto-trigger downstream pipelines to not trigger (without errors):

1. If both the pipelines B & C have mutually exclusive blacklist, i.e. say A has 2 folders ’src/’ ’test/’ and B ignores test/ while C ignores src/ AND there are no commits to both folders together then B & C run for different commits only. This leaves D with no compatible runs of B & C that it can trigger off of.

2. If the upstream pipelines B & C are timer triggered / manually triggered they always run off of latest change in A. So if you trigger B & C at different times they may have different revisions of A, causing incompatibility for D.

3. The algorithm always goes down during its search for compatibility. Consider below scenario:

```
G -> A -> C
|         |
+ -> B ---+
```
* A has run a1 (with g1), a2 (with g3).
* B has run b1 (with g1), b2 (with g3).
* C has run c1 (with a1 & b1).
* Before C runs with a2 & b2 A is triggered a3 (with g2).

Now during fan-in resolution for C we see g2 so look for B with <= g2 find b1 (g1). Now we look for A with <= g1 find a1 (g1) and resolution stops at a1, b1, g1 with which C has already run. So it doesn't run. Even though there is newer revision of B & C available which are compatible! (a2 & b2)

General reasons for auto-trigger downstream pipelines to not trigger (with errors):

1. If one of the pipelines B or C (say B) is paused/manual and is not running for long, while the other pipeline (C in this case) runs constantly then the resolution of downstream D fails after a few runs of C. This is because Go tries to resolve the upstream pipelines by considering max. upto 100 instances of each upstream pipeline after which it will stop resolution to avoid consuming too much CPU cycles.

2. If an upstream pipeline (say B) is triggered with a older version of A then Go tries to find a version of C which is compatible with that version of A or something older than that. This can fail if you select a version of A that is very old for the same reason as above.

3. If config of an upstream pipeline is changed. say you change A ->X OR add/remove a new material to either of B/C, the resolution of D will fail until there is a green run of all upstream pipelines with the latest material config.
