Go maintains a data-structure called Pipeline timeline. It stores pipeline instances for each pipeline in "schedule order" & "natural order" separately.

#### Schedule order

The order in which pipeline got triggered. This is simply based on pipeline counter.

Ex: If pipeline P ran 3 times P1, P2 & P3 with trigger times T1, T2 & T3 respectively with T1 < T2 < T3, then schedule order would be P1, P2, P3

#### Natural order

The order of pipeline ordered by SCM commit time. 

Ex: If pipeline P depends on git G which has 3 commits G1, G2 & G3 with commit times T1, T2 & T3 respectively with T1 < T2 < T3. P1 has triggered with G1 while P2 has triggered with G3 & P3 has triggered with G2. then the natural order would be P1, P3, P2.

This data-structure can be used if you are trying to find a pipeline instance that is older than the current instance in terms of code.

Ex: In the above example current pipeline is P2 and you want an older instance of pipeline, P3 is not an older instance since it has a newer commit (g3) & P1 is the older instance since it has an older commit (g1).
