There is a corner case where a pipeline can be both an upstream pipeline & a downstream pipeline for a particular pipeline. This can happen due to change in config where A was upstream of B when B ran after which A became downstream of B. This causes a cycle in VSM of A and causes the VSM rendering algorithm to go into an infinite loop. To avoid this we had to put in a cycle detection check before rendering the VSM.

    has_cycle()
        root_nodes = get all root nodes

        visited = new set
        for each root in root_nodes
            current_path = new set

            visited.add(root)
            current_path.add(root)

            has_cycle(root, visited, current_path)
        end
    end

    has_cycle(node, visited, current_path)
        if (visited.contains(node))
            return
        end

        if (current_path.contains(node))
            throw new CyclicDependencyException()
        end

        current_path.add(node)

        for each child in node.child_nodes
            has_cycle(child, visited, current_path))
        end

        current_path.remove(node)

        visited.add(node)
    end
