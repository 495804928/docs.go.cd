Go has a very strong modelling capability in terms of parallel-serial-parallel-serial (pipelinestage-job-task) division of work. It supports multiple SCM / pipeline dependencies & allows fetching of artifacts from ancestor pipelines.

Go has good visualisation of things from pipeline level, i.e. everything from pipeline level was well organised for information consumption.

* what revisions of each direct upstream SCM / pipeline dependency did the pipeline run with (materials tab)
* which stage ran after which one (stage details), how much time did the each stage take (stage graph)
* which jobs ran on which agent, how much time did each job take, status of job (jobs tab in stage details)
* what was the setup that each task ran under i.e. OS, environment variables etc. & what was the output of each task (console.log)

But the visualisation at work-flow level was missing, i.e. if user had to know which revision of ancestor upstream pipeline/SCM did the current pipeline run with he had to trace the path manually. It was also not possible to check revisions of all the upstream SCMs at once. To solve this problem we had to come up with a visualisation where the whole work-flow of current pipeline (upstream & downstream) could be layed out as a graph. This visualisation would also help user know where in downstream his commit is.
