Go has a very strong modelling capability in terms of parallel-serial-parallel-serial (pipeline-stage-job-task) division of work. It supports multiple SCM / pipeline dependencies & allows fetching of artifacts from ancestor pipelines.

Go has good visualisation of things from pipeline level, i.e. everything from pipeline level is well organised for information consumption.

* pipeline history page, stage history widget (on stage details page) & job history widget (on job details page) gives good snapshot of history
* what revisions of each direct upstream SCM / pipeline dependency did the pipeline run with (materials tab)
* which stage ran after which one (stage details), how much time did the each stage take (stage graph)
* which jobs ran on which agent, how much time did each job take, status of job (jobs tab in stage details)
* what was the setup that each task ran under i.e. OS, environment variables etc. & what was the output of each task (console.log)

But there was need for visualisation at work-flow level, i.e. we needed a visual way to answer following questions:
* what is the setup / how does a commit flow to reach production
* where in downstream is your commit currently?
* which revision of ancestor upstream pipeline / SCM did the current pipeline run with

To solve this problem we had to come up with a visualisation where the whole work-flow of current pipeline (upstream & downstream) could be layed out as a graph.
