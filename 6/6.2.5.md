Fan-in algorithm is used for resolving the correct upstream dependency revisions only for auto-trigger pipelines. It does not take effect when you manually trigger a pipeline / the pipeline is timer triggered.

We could bring fan-in resolution for a manual trigger. Ex: user can open revision selection popup. Select revisions for materials user cares for & click 'resolve revisions' which could resolve the revisions for other upstream materials & fill the pop-up. This would help user select consistent upstream revisions without having to manually resolve them. When user does not select revisions for any material then its equivalent to revisions that would be set during auto-trigger.

Handle corner cases better. May be an improved algorithm which covers more cases than the current one. Atleast give easily consumable warnings / error messages when resolution fails. Users must be able to debug the problem by themselves.
