# 6.4 Compare pipeline

### 6.4.1 Overview

Go allows you to compare any two builds of a pipeline and see an aggregation of all the changes that happened between the two instances.

More information about this feature is available [here](http://www.thoughtworks.com/products/docs/go/13.4/help/compare_pipelines.html).

### 6.4.2 Implementation

> Note: This feature uses the concept of **natural ordering**

#### 6.4.2.1 Parameters

**pipelineName** : The name of the pipeline for comparision
**fromCounter** : The pipeline counter (inclusive) to compare from.
**toCounter** : The pipeline counter (inclusive) to compare uptil.

#### 6.4.2.2 Changesets

This feature displays the material changeset that have contributed between the counters under comparison. The changeset is determinded by 

1. loading all the **MaterialRevisions** between the two runs
2. parsing the comment field of each material revision to obtain a list of mingle card numbers that are part of this changeset. The matcher is done as follows:

```
Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("#(\\d+)");
...
Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(comment);
```


#### 6.4.2.3 Mingle Gadget

If Mingle is configured, the mingle card numbers obtained in [Changesets](#6422-changesets) section is used to fetch the mingle gadget. Mingle acts as a gadget provider and serves back the content.

Go ships with a rails plugin named **tw_studios_gadgets** which is placed in ```<rails app>/vendor/plugins/tw_studios_gadgets```. This rails plugin is responsible for serving requesting Mingle to serve out the gadget.
