In the above graph the edge B ->E spans across 2 layers. We need to avoid edges that cut across multiple layers. This would help us reduce edge crossings (explained in next section). To avoid having edges across layers we introduce one dummy nodes in every layer between source & destination node. So in the above graph we insert a dummy node X between B ->E making it B -> X ->E

    create_dummy_nodes()
        root_nodes = get all root nodes

        visited = new set
        for each root in root_nodes
            create_dummy_nodes(root, visited)
        end
    end

    create_dummy_nodes(root)
        if (visited.contains(node))
            return
	end

        visited.add(node)

        for each child in root.child_nodes
            if (child.layer > node.layer + 1)
                dummy_node.layer = node.layer + 1
                node.child = dummy_node
                dummy_node.child = child
                create_dummy_nodes(dummy_node)
            else
                create_dummy_nodes(child)
            end
        end
    end
