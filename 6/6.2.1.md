### Challenges:

Fan-in is the most complex feature in Go. Took us really long to develop & test it specially because it was a change in core of Go (Scheduling). Went through 3 algorithm re-writes. Is really hard to debug / pin down issues because of the recursive nature of algorithm. Has lot of tricky corner cases.

#### Efficiency:

The algorithm had to be effecient since there are a 1000+ pipelines in some of our customer setups. And Go tries to schedule 10 pipelines every sec using 10 threads which meant if algorithm for scheduling took longer then the threads will be blocked for that much time longer, which will drastically increase the amount of time Go takes to detect a check-in & schedule pipelines that can trigger off of that change.

### Graph Representation & Instance Data population

To be able to implement the algorithm we needed to have Graph representation of whole upstream. To build this we traverse the config recusively from current pipeline and store all pipelines & SCMs that we come across. We populate parent & child information in the nodes during traversal.
