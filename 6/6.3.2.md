We assign a layer to every node in graph. Layers are assigned left to right increasing layer
number by one for every layer. Ex:

    A -> B -----> E
    |             ^
    + -> C -> D --+

For the above graph, A would be assigned layer 0, B & C would be assigned layer 1, D would be assigned layer 2 & E would be assigned layer 3.

One possible approach is to do a DFS without tracking which nodes are visited already so as trace all possible paths. Tracing all paths is essential in this approach since the child node should be further than any of its parent node so as to avoid back edges. In the above graph E should be assigned layer 3 & not 2 as suggested by B ->E. This would be possible by tracing C ->D ->E. But total number of paths increase combinatorially with increasing number of nodes / edges.

The trick is to do a topological sort of nodes & then loop through the list assigning layer to all child nodes of current node. This would ensure each node is ahead of all its parent nodes since all the parent nodes would be assigned a layer before itself ensuring the current node is assigned a layer ahead of all its parent nodes.

```
    assign_layer_to_nodes()
        all_nodes = get all nodes
        
        topological sort(all_nodes)

        for each node in all_nodes
            if (node.layer == null)
                node.layer = 1
            end
            
	    for each child in node.child_nodes
                if (child.layer == null || child.layer < node.layer + 1)
                    child.layer = node.layer + 1
                end
            end
        end
        
        # move root nodes closer to its children to avoid long edges
        root_nodes = get all root nodes
        
        for each root_node in root_nodes
            root_node.layer = minimum_layer_of_all_children(root_node) - 1
        end
    end
```
