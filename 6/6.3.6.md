Currently VSM only shows upstream & downstream of a pipeline instance, i.e. everything is wrt to a pipeline instance.

We could render VSM for a commit. This would be useful in a few scenarios. Ex: If the setup is like below.

```
G -> A -> C
|         |
+ -> B ---+
```

When you see VSM for A you will not see B while if you see VSM for B you will not see A. The only way to see both of them is to see VSM for C. But if we could show VSM for a commit then that VSM would contain both A & B that triggered off of that commit. Its more intuitive to trace your commit in this view.

The algorithm can be directly reused to lay the whole config. It would be useful to show the whole CI/CD setup of an organization. It would also be useful during pipeline creation. Ex: you can create a new pipeline by dragging & dropping dependencies into the new pipeline etc.
