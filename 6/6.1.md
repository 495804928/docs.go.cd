# 6.1 Dashboard

In the context of Go, the landing page is often called the *dashboard*. The dashboard presents the user with a view of all the pipelines that he/she is authorized to view. The dashboard contains the below listed functional areas:

- Personalise
- Search
- Pipeline Group(s)
- Pipeline(s)

## 6.1.1 Personalise

A user can blacklist the set of pipelines that he/she does not wish to view on the dashboard. This blacklisting is stored as a comma-separated list in the database under the table named **pipelineselections**. The table is tied to a user via the *userid* column.
