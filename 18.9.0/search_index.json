If you want to know more about Continuous Integration and\nContinuous Delivery, in general, you can refer to Martin Fowler's articles on the subject: Continuous\nIntegration and Continuous\nDelivery.\nIf you're very new to GoCD, the Getting Started Guide is a good\nstarting point to get a good understanding of the concepts while trying them out on a real GoCD instance.\nIndex\n\nTask\nJob\nStage\nPipeline\nMaterials\nPipeline Dependencies\nFan-in and fan-out\nValue Stream Map\nArtifacts\nFetching artifacts\n\n\nAgent\nResources\nEnvironment\nEnvironment Variables\nTemplates\n\n\nTask\nA task, or a build task, is an action that needs to be performed. Usually, it is a single command.\nThe task shown in the image below is set to run the command ant -Dmodule=A compile, when executed by GoCD.\n\n  \n  Figure 1: Task\n\n\n\nJob\nA job consists of multiple tasks, each of which will be run in order. If a task in a job fails, then the job is considered failed, and unless\nspecified otherwise, the rest of the tasks in the job will not be run.\nThe job shown in the image below has three tasks. The ant task will be run first, followed by the rake task and finally, the shell script is run.\n\n  \n  Figure 2: Job\n\n\nEvery task in a job is run as an independent program, and so, changes made by a task to any of its environment variables will not affect subsequent\ntasks. Any changes made by a task on the filesystem will be visible to subsequent tasks.\n\nStage\nA stage consists of multiple jobs, each of which can run independently of the others. This means that GoCD can and does parallelize the execution of\njobs in a stage. If a job fails, then the stage is considered failed. However, since jobs are independent of each other, the other jobs in the\nstage will be run to completion.\nThe stage shown in the image below has two jobs, one which builds module A and another which builds module B. The success or failure of the first\njob cannot affect the success or failure of the second.\n\n  \n  Figure 3: Stage\n\n\n\nPipeline\nA pipeline consists of multiple stages, each of which will be run in order. If a stage fails, then the pipeline is considered failed and the following\nstages will not be started.\nThe pipeline shown in the image below has three stages, the first with two jobs, the second with three and the third with one. If the first stage fails,\nthen the second and third stages will not be run.\n\n  \n  Figure 4: Pipeline\n\n\nSince an image of a pipeline can get quite big, the rest of this document will use a slightly smaller representation of a pipeline, which hides the jobs\nand tasks. This representation is shown below.\n\n  \n  Figure 5: Pipeline (small representation)\n\n\n\n\nMaterials and triggers (or \"When do these tasks, jobs, stages and pipelines run?\")\nA material is a cause for a pipeline to run. Often, it is a source code material repository (Git, SVN, Mercurial, etc). The GoCD Server\ncontinuously polls configured materials and when a new change or commit is found, the corresponding pipelines are run or \"triggered\".\nThere are different kinds of materials. Here's an example of a Git material. When a commit is made to the repository configured in the Git material,\nthe pipeline gets triggered.\n\n  \n  Figure 6: Material - git\n\n\nSimilarly, an SVN material is shown below. GoCD has support for many different kinds of source code materials, as well as a plugin endpoint for\nextending the kinds of materials it supports.\n\n  \n  Figure 7: Material - SVN\n\n\nA \"timer trigger\" is a special kind of material that triggers a pipeline at a specified time, or at specified intervals.\n\n  \n  Figure 8: Timer trigger\n\n\nA pipeline can even be configured with multiple materials. The pipeline shown below is configured with a Git material and an SVN material. When either\nrepository has a new commit, the pipeline is triggered.\n\n  \n  Figure 9: Multiple materials\n\n\n\n\nPipeline dependency material\nMaterials really start becoming powerful when a stage in a pipeline is used as a material for another pipeline.\nIn the image shown below, Stage 2 of Pipeline 1 is configured as a material for Pipeline 2. Whenever Stage 2 of Pipeline 1 finishes\nsuccessfully, Pipeline 2 triggers. In a setup such as this, Pipeline 1 is called the Upstream Pipeline and Pipeline 2 is called the\nDownstream Pipeline. Stage 2 of Pipeline 1 is called the Upstream Dependency of Pipeline 2.\n\n  \n  Figure 10: Pipeline dependency - Last stage\n\n\nAny stage of a pipeline can be used as a material. In the image shown below, as soon as Stage 1 of Pipeline 1 finishes successfully, Pipeline 2\nwill trigger and start. Now, both Stage 2 of Pipeline 1 and Stage 1 of Pipeline 2 can run simultaneously.\n\n  \n  Figure 11: Pipeline dependency - Any stage\n\n\n\n\nFan-out and fan-in\nA material is said to \"fan-out\" to downstream pipelines, when the material's completion causes multiple downstream pipelines to trigger, as is shown\nin the image below. The cause of a fan-out need not always be a pipeline dependency material. It can be any material.\n\n  \n  Figure 12: Fan-out\n\n\nA \"fan-in\" is when multiple upstream materials are needed to trigger a downstream pipeline, as shown in the image below. One important and interesting\naspect of fan-in is that GoCD will ensure that the revisions of upstream pipelines are consistent, before triggering a downstream pipeline.\nIn the image shown below, this means that if Stage 2 of Pipeline 1 is slow and Stage 1 of Pipeline 2 is quick, Pipeline 3 will wait for Pipeline 1\nto finish before triggering. It will not trigger with an inconsistent or old revision of Pipeline 1, just because Pipeline 2 finished quickly.\n\n  \n  Figure 13: Fan-in\n\n\n\nValue Stream Map (VSM)\nThe Value Stream Map (VSM) is an end-to-end view of a pipeline, its upstream dependencies and the downstream pipelines it triggers. When deciding which\npipelines to trigger, GoCD's fan-in and fan-out resolution will take care of all the dependencies consistently.\nFor instance, in the image below, when a new commit is found in Repo 1 (git), GoCD will not trigger Pipeline 5 immediately. It will wait for Pipeline 1 to\ntrigger and finish successfully, then it will wait for Pipeline 4 to trigger and finish successfully. Finally, it will trigger Pipeline 5 with the same\nrevision of Repo 1 that was used with Pipeline 1.\n\n  \n  Figure 14: VSM\n\n\n\nArtifacts\nEvery job in Go can optionally publish \"Artifacts\", which are files or directories. After the job is run, GoCD will ensure that the specified artifacts are\npublished and made available to the user, and other downstream stages and pipelines.\nA representation of artifacts is shown below. As shown, every job can have artifacts. In this case, the job on the top has two files and a directory as\nits artifacts and the job below it has two directories and a file as its artifacts.\n\n  \n  Figure 15: Artifacts\n\n\n\nFetching artifacts\nGoCD provides a special task called a \"Fetch Artifact Task\", which allows artifacts to be fetched and used, from any ancestor pipeline - that is, any\npipeline that is upstream of the current pipeline. GoCD will ensure that the correct version of the artifact is fetched, irrespective of anything else\nthat might be going on in the system.\nIn the image shown below, the jobs in Stage 1 of Pipeline 1 publish some artifacts. In Stage 2, a Fetch Artifact Task fetches the artifact published in\nStage 1. Then, in Pipeline 2, a Fetch Artifact Task fetches an artifact published in Pipeline 1. Finally, in Pipeline 3, which is further downstream,\na Fetch Artifact Task fetches an artifact from Pipeline 1, through Pipeline 2.\n\n  \n  Figure 16: Fetch Artifact Task\n\n\n\nAgent (or \"Where do these tasks, jobs, stages and pipelines run?\")\nGoCD Agents are the workers in the GoCD ecosystem. All tasks configured in the system run on GoCD Agents. The GoCD Server polls for changes in material (this\nhappens on the GoCD Server itself) and then, when a change is detected and a pipeline needs to be triggered, the corresponding jobs are assigned to the\nagents, for them to execute the tasks.\nAgents pick up jobs which are assigned to them, execute the tasks in the job and report the status of the job to the GoCD Server. Then,\nthe GoCD Server collates all the information from the different jobs and then decides on the status of the stage.\nAn agent is represented by a monitor in the image below.\n\n  \n  Figure 17: Agent\n\n\n\n\nResources\nAgents and jobs can be enhanced with \"Resources\". Resources are free-form tags, that help Go decide which agents are capable of picking up specific jobs.\nIn the image below, the Firefox® and Tux icons represent resources on the agent. The resources can be thought of as the agent broadcasting its\ncapabilities. Resources are defined by administrators and can mean anything the administrators wants them to mean. In this case, it might be an indication that this\nagent has Firefox installed for running functional tests and it is a Linux box.\n\n  \n  Figure 18: Resources on an agent\n\n\nResources become very useful, when jobs are assigned resources. In the case of jobs, resources can be thought of as the capabilities they need in an\nagent, for them to be run successfully.\nIn the image below, Job 1 claims that it needs an agent with the Firefox® resource. Job 2 claims that it needs an agent with the Linux®\nresource. Job 3 claims that it needs an agent with both Firefox® and Linux® resources. Job 4 claims that it doesn't need any resources.\n\n  \n  Figure 19: Agents, jobs and resources\n\n\nIn the case of the image above:\n\nJob 1 can be assigned to either Agents 1 or 3, by the GoCD Server.\n\nJob 2 can be assigned only to Agent 1 (since it is the only agent to provide the Linux resource).\n\nJob 3 can be assigned only to Agent 1 (since it is the only agent to provide both those resources).\n\nJob 4 can be assigned to any of the three agents, since that job needs no special resource matching.\n\n\nNote that the fact that Agent 3 has an Apple® resource does not stop it from being assigned a job. It just happens to be a resource which is not\nneeded by any of the jobs shown.\n\nEnvironments\nAn \"Environment\" in GoCD is a way to group and isolate pipelines and agents. The rules of an environment are:\n\nA pipeline can be associated with a maximum of one environment.\n\nAn agent can be associated with multiple environments or no environments.\n\nAn agent can only pick up jobs belonging to pipelines in environments that it is associated with.\n\nAn agent which is associated with an environment cannot pick up jobs in pipelines which are not associated with any environment.\n\n\nIn the image below representing environments, Environment 1 is composed of Pipeline 1, Pipeline 2, Agent 1, Agent 2 and Agent 3. Environment 2\nis composed of Pipeline 3, Pipeline 4, Agent 3 and Agent 4. Pipelines 5, 6 and 7 and Agent 5 do not belong to any environment.\n\n  \n  Figure 20: Environments\n\n\nIn a case such as the image shown above:\n\nJobs in Pipelines 1 and 2 can only be picked up by Agents 1, 2 and 3.\n\nJobs in Pipelines 3 and 4 can only be picked up by Agents 3 and 4.\n\nJobs in Pipelines 5, 6 and 7 can only be picked up Agent 5.\n\n\nIn addition to the restrictions related to matching of Environments, resources need to match between the agents and jobs, as detailed in the section\non Resources.\n\nEnvironment Variables\nEnvironment variables are often confused with \"Environments\". They're not directly related. In GoCD, \"Environment Variables\" are user-defined variables that\nare defined in the configuration. These environment variables are made available to tasks just like other environment variables available to processes\nwhen they run in an operation system.\nEnvironment variables can be defined at multiple levels: Within environments, within pipelines, within stages and within jobs. They follow a cascading system\nwhere environment variables defined at the \"Environment\" level get overridden by environment variables defined at the pipeline level and so on.\nIn the image shown below, there are 4 environment variables defined at the environment level, 3 at the pipeline level and 2 each at the stage and job levels.\nThe environment variable, ENV_ENV has been set to a value of 1 at the environment level, ENV_STG has been set to 2 at stage level and so on.\n\n  \n  Figure 21: Environment Variables\n\n\nThe environment variables provided to every task in this job will be:\nENV_ENV => 1\nENV_PIP => 2\nENV_STG => 3\nENV_JOB => 4\nMY_VAR  => 4\nFor instance: ENV_PIP set at the environment level (to a value of 1) is overridden by ENV_PIP set at the pipeline level (to a value of 2). Since ENV_PIP\nis not defined at the stage and job levels, the value of ENV_PIP will be 2. The other environment variables can be reasoned about in the same way.\n\nTemplates\nThis section is a work in progress.\nImage attributions\n\nGit logo - Wikimedia Commons\nSubversion logo - Wikimedia Commons\nClock face - Wikimedia Commons\nConsole - Wikimedia Commons\nFirefox logo - Wikimedia Commons\nTux - Wikimedia Commons\nApple logo (Black) - Wikimedia Commons\nGnome text mime - Wikimedia Commons\nBlue folder - Wikimedia Commons\n\n"},"navigation/":{"url":"navigation/","title":"GoCD Tour","keywords":"","body":"\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n       Go\n       TOUR\n    \n    \n"},"navigation/pipelines_dashboard_page.html":{"url":"navigation/pipelines_dashboard_page.html","title":"Pipeline Dashboard","summary":"In GoCD's pipeline dashboard, you can see all the instances of a given pipeline that are currently in progress.","keywords":"","body":"Pipelines Dashboard in GoCD\nThis shows the current activity in the system.

Everything to the left of this pipeline are its upstream dependencies, ie all the materials that have contributed to this instance. Everything to the right are its downstream dependencies, ie, all the pipelines that it can potentially trigger or contribute to.\n\nUpstream Dependencies\nThe upstream dependencies of the main pipeline are taken from history and show all the source control and pipeline dependency materials that have contributed to the main pipeline. Even when the GoCD Configuration changes after a certain instance of a pipeline, its upstream dependency graph will continue to reflect the older configuration with which it was run. This also means that it would display pipelines that do not exist in the configuration any more.\nLet us assume that instance '1' of pipeline 'Build' is as below\n\nIf the configuration changes to replace the pipeline 'Services' with 2 pipelines - 'Service-1' and 'Service-2', the next instance of pipeline 'Build' would reflect the change.\n\nValue Stream Map of pipeline 'Build' with counter '1' would look as below\n\nDownstream Dependencies\nThe downstream dependencies of the main pipeline instance indicate what can happen with it. This information is always taken from the latest configuration. Pipelines that have not run yet are also shown\n\nIf Environment-1 is removed from the configuration, the Value Stream Map for the same instance of 'Build' would look as below.\n\nMultiple Pipeline Instances\nA pipeline could be re-triggered multiple times with the same revision. In such cases, all the instances are shown in descending order against that pipeline. In the below example, 'Deploy' has been triggered thrice with counter '2' of pipeline 'FunctionalTests'.\n\nViewing the Value Stream Map\nEvery pipeline label in GoCD directs you to the value stream map of that instance of the pipeline.\n\nYou can access Value Stream Map for a commit in 2 ways:\n\n\nPermissions\nThe permissions required to view a value stream map are as follows:\n\nGoCD Administrators have access to the value stream maps of all the pipelines that are configured.\nUsers with view permissions for a pipeline will be able to view the value stream map for all instances of that pipeline.\n\nHowever, there is one special case to be noted where the pipeline details might not be shown completely. If the user does not have view permissions for a pipeline in the Value Stream Map, its details, like the stages and instances run will not be shown.\n\nIf you are using Internet Explorer as your browser please note that Value Stream Map is supported with only versions 9 and above.\n"},"installation/":{"url":"installation/","title":"Installing GoCD","summary":"GoCD installation instructions for both server and agent.","keywords":"","body":"Installing GoCD\nGoCD consists of two installable components. The GoCD Server and one or more GoCD Agents. They have a one-to-many\nrelationship in that many GoCD agents can connect to one GoCD Server. To do any real work, you need at least one agent,\nsince agents are the real builders or work executors in the system.\nSince installation instructions vary per operating system, the installation instruction pages linked below will ask you\nto choose your operating system and then provide you instructions for that operating system.\nGo to: GoCD Server installation instructions\nAlso, go to: GoCD Agent installation instructions\nWhatever operating systems you install the GoCD server and (at least one) GoCD agent on, the default ports used by the\nserver are 8153 (HTTP port) and 8154 (HTTPS port). So, after installation you should be able to access either\nhttp://localhost:8153 or http://your-server-installation-hostname:8153 and you should see a screen\nsuch as this:\n\nOnce the agent is started, switching to the agents tab by clicking on the \"Agents\" link in the header should take you to\na screen where the agent shows up and is idle. Like this:\n\nAn agent or agents can be installed on any node, and not necessarily the node that the GoCD Server is installed on. The\nonly requirements are that ports 8153 and 8154 of the GoCD Server are accessible from the node that the agents are\ninstalled on.\nIf you are still having trouble with the installation, take a look at the troubleshooting guide.\n"},"installation/system_requirements.html":{"url":"installation/system_requirements.html","title":"System requirements","summary":"Requirements for installation of GoCD server and agents.

The artifact repository\ncan fill up quickly (especially if you are storing large binaries). If you don't create a separate partition for\nartifacts and your system disk fills up, GoCD and other applications on your system will behave unexpectedly.

This means that if you use ant for your projects the server and all agents need to have ant installed and available on the system path.\nBacking up your data\nConfiguration Backup\nAs part of the configuration two files need to be backed up:\n\nGoCD's configuration is saved in the cruise-config.xml file\nCipher file for password encryption.\n\nBased on the OS your GoCD server is running on, both these files can be found at:\n\n\n\nOperating System\nLocation\n\n\n\n\nLinux\n/etc/go\n\n\nWindows\n[Go install directory]\\config\n\n\nMac OS X\n~/Library/Application Support/Go Server\n\n\n\nDatabase backup\nIt is critical that the Go server be stopped before taking a backup of the database. If the GoCD server is not stopped, the backup may be corrupted.

While it is not essential to backup the artifacts before an upgrade, it is good practice to make regular backups of this directory.\nYou can configure where GoCD stores build artifacts. The following are the default locations of the artifacts if you have not customized its location:\n\n\n\nOperating System\nLocation\n\n\n\n\nLinux\n/var/lib/go-server/artifacts\n\n\nWindows\n[Go install directory]\\artifacts\n\n\nMac OS X\n~/Library/Application Support/Go Server/artifacts\n\n\n\nUpgrading to the new version\nYou do not need to stop the Agents to perform an upgrade. GoCD agents will automatically update to the correct version of the software. You do not need to upgrade the GoCD agents. Any builds in progress will be rescheduled, and the existing pipelines will complete as expected.\nIf you are upgrading from a pre-2.1 release, the agent's directory structure will continue to be called \"cruise-agent\" and will not be renamed to \"go-agent\". This is normal and will not cause any issues.\nOn linux, you can ignore any permission errors logged as part of the upgrade of the cruise agent from a pre-2.1 release\nGoCD will perform upgrades of its internal data structures when it starts. This process may take some time for installations with a large number of historical builds (10 to 15 minutes on very large installations). If you suspect that there is a problem with the upgrade, check the go-server.log to see if there are any reported errors. This is a one-time migration and subsequent restarts will be much faster.\nWindows\nRun the GoCD installer. Make sure that you specify the same directory as your previously installed version.\nIf you have changed the GoCD Server Windows service to run as a different user, you will need to repeat this configuration change.\nThe installer will automatically start the service. Once GoCD completes its internal data changes, you should be able to see the GoCD webpage. Any existing Agents should automatically reconnect. Any builds in progress should continue, or be rescheduled.\nLinux\nDebian based distributions (i.e. Ubuntu)\nRun the GoCD installer as described\nsudo dpkg -i [go-server-package-name]\nRPM based distributions (i.e. RedHat)\nRun the GoCD installer as described\nsudo rpm -U [go-server-package-name]\nMacintosh OSX\nThe Macintosh OSX edition of Go does not support upgrades. You should follow the steps above to backup your data, uninstall Go/Cruise (by dragging the application into trash), and then perform a fresh installation.\nNotes\nUse the notes from this section when upgrading to a particular version of GoCD.\nVersion 2.3\nAs part of the 2.3 upgrade, the dest attribute of a material configured in a pipeline is case-insensitive. This would mean that if you have a pipeline P1 with two materials, say material M1 with dest = \"foo\" and material M2 with dest = \"Foo\", after the upgrade the dest folders will be automatically changed to M1 dest = \"foo_[random_string]\" and M2 dest = \"Foo_[random_string]\"\n"},"installation/configuring_server_details.html":{"url":"installation/configuring_server_details.html","title":"Configuring Server Details","summary":"Configure GoCD server and create a separate partition for GoCD server artifacts.","keywords":"","body":"Configuring GoCD server details\nArtifact repository configuration\nGoCD needs no configuration once installed.

To bump up the total number for file descriptors user and system, follow these steps:\n\nEdit /etc/security/limits.conf and add the lines:soft nofile 1024 * hard nofile 65535\nEdit /etc/pam.d/login, adding the line: session required /lib/security/pam_limits.so\nThe system file descriptor limit can be increased by setting fs.file-max in the file /etc/sysctl.conf. To set the limit to 65535 use echo \"fs.file-max = 65535\" >> /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nTuning your JVM\nEnsure that the latest JVM is used always, as there are major performance improvements with every release.\nThe minimum and maximum JVM heap space allocated to the GoCD server affects its performance. GoCD uses default values of 512m and 1024m for minimum and maximum JVM heap sizes respectively. However, for production environments, we recommend setting the minimum and maximum values to an identical value.\nThe default heap settings mentioned above are for a 32-bit JVM. But if the GoCD server is facing performance issues we recommend doubling the values in the heap settings and measuring performance. If its seen that more than 3 GB of heap memory is needed, we recommend a switch to 64-bit JVM. Our tests show that GoCD server performs much better on a 64 bit JVM than a 32 bit JVM provided the heap memory has been increased appropriately. This is needed because 64-bit JVM makes use of 64-bit addresses instead of 32bits, allowing it to use more memory.\nStart with the default settings and increase the heap memory incrementally to suit your application.\nStorage\nFor optimal performance in artifact transfer GoCD would need storage with good disk I/O throughput. We recommend local storage for GoCD database and artifacts. Disk space can be reclaimed through deletion of historical artifacts.\nIf using network storage is preferred, ensure that the speeds and throughput are good.\nUse RAID Configuration for higher throughput if the GoCD Server is expected to be an intensive setup. If you expect to have large artifacts you could use use different RAID configurations for GoCD database and artifacts. For example, 2 drives on RAID1 can be be used for the GoCD database (for redundancy), 3+ hard drives on RAID5 can be used for artifacts so that access to database and artifacts is optimized.\nImproving Server Startup Time\nThe start up time for a very large GoCD Server instance could be improved by delaying material polling and pipeline scheduling to a few seconds after the server starts up. This would allow the server to warm up and cache some of the data before it is bombarded with threads that poll for material updates and pipelines that need to be scheduled. Following are the JVM properties that enable such a delay:\n\ncruise.material.update.delay - This value is specified in milliseconds. It has a default value of 10,000. This means that material polling would only start 10s after the server starts.\n\ncruise.produce.build.cause.delay - Likewise, this value is also specified in milliseconds. It again defaults to 10,000 meaning that scheduling of pipelines would take place only 10s after the server starts up.\n\n\nThe two values above do not affect the frequency of material polling or pipeline scheduling.\nTroubleshooting\nEnable GC Logging\nAn easy way to check the memory usage, heap size (initial and over time) and GC metrics of the application is by turning on GC logging. GC logging can be enabled using the following JVM arguments while starting the application (Note: the log file specified as file is reset each time the VM starts.)\n-verbose:gc -Xloggc:file -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps\nIn case of the GoCD server, these arguments will have to be added in the script that starts the Go jar:\n\nFor linux : /usr/share/go-server/server.sh\nFor Windows: [go_server_installation_dir]/server.cmd In most cases GoCD is installed in C:\\Program Files\\Go Server\n\nUsing JConsole\nJConsole is a graphical monitoring tool to monitor Java Virtual Machine (JVM) which comes as part of the JDK installation. It can be used to monitor the current state of a process without much overhead. If the GoCD server's performance is slow, some metrics can be immediately analysed using jconsole.\nSince jconsole is a graphical tool, make sure you have an access to display, when running the following command. That is, use ssh -X or VNC if GoCD is on linux. Use remote desktop if the GoCD server is on windows.\n$ jconsole\n\nSelect the local process go.jar when the jconsole GUI opens up. This shows the current heap memory usage, threads, cpu usage etc. Screenshots of the VM Summary and the overview page can be taken to be sent to the GoCD Support team, if required.\n\nPlease note that in case of linux, jconsole will have to be started as 'go' user. In Windows, starting the process as administrator should suffice.\n\nMore information about jconsole can be found here.\nCPU and memory profiling\nYourkit java profiler is a recommended tool for profiling the CPU and memory of the GO Server.\nTo start using yourkit, download the latest version of the Yourkit java profiler from http://www.yourkit.com/download/index.jsp. Unpack to [yourkit_profiler_directory] The following steps will enable the GoCD server to pick up the yourkit profiler agent and enable us to take memory and cpu snapshots.\nFor Linux\n\nCreate a symlink for libyjpagent.so file to /usr/lib/yourkit folder. When the GoCD server starts up, it looks at this folder to see if it needs to start with profiling enabled or not. If you want to change the default path of the yourkit agent, you can edit server.sh at /usr/share/go-server/server.sh\n$ sudo ln -s [yourkit_profiler_directory]/bin/linux-x86-32/libyjpagent.so /usr/lib/yourkit/libyjpagent.so\n\nFor 64-bit JVM, the command is:\n$ sudo ln -s [yourkit_profiler_directory]/bin/linux-x86-64/libyjpagent.so /usr/lib/yourkit/libyjpagent.so\n\n\nRestart the server after this, and the yourkit agent should get picked up by the server VM. Let the server start up and agents get registered.\n\n\nFor Windows\n\nBy default, GoCD server looks for the yourkit profiler agent yjpagent.dll in the location C:\\yjpagent.dll. Therefore, copy the file yjpagent.dll (which is the yourkit profiler agent) from [yourkit_profiler_directory]\\bin\\win32 to C:\\yjpagent.dll. Copy the file from [yourkit_profiler_directory}\\bin\\win64 if you are using 64 bit JVM.\nTo change the above mentioned default location: define environment variable YOURKIT_PATH with value equal to location of yjpagent.dll.\nIf you are running the GoCD server as a service, you will need to perform an additional step. In the config folder of the GoCD server installation, edit the wrapper-properties.conf file, and add an additional property with the following value\n\"-agentpath: [Path to yjpagent.dll]=port=6133,builtinprobes=none\"\nFor example, if there are 16 properties already defined, add this 17th property as shown below\nwrapper.java.additional.17=\"-agentpath:C:\\yjpagent.dll=port=6133,builtinprobes=none\"\n\n\nUse the following steps to take profile the application and take snapshots. The hostname mentioned here is the hostname of the GoCD Server. In most cases, it would be 'localhost'. The value of port is 6133, because GoCD starts the yjpagent on port 6133.\n\nTo start profiling, run:\n$ java -jar [yourkit_profiler_directory]/lib/yjp-controller-api-redist.jar hostname port  start-cpu-sampling\n\n$ java -jar [yourkit_profiler_directory]/lib/yjp-controller-api-redist.jar hostname port start-monitor-profiling\n\nIf memory allocation profiling is also required:\n$ java -jar [yourkit_profiler_directory]/lib/yjp-controller-api-redist.jar hostname port start-alloc-recording-adaptive\n\n\nLet the server run for some time till you start seeing performance problems. 30 mins of snapshot should give us enough data.\n\nTo capture the snapshot - Run:\n$ java -jar [yourkit_profiler_directory]/lib/yjp-controller-api-redist.jar hostname port capture-performance-snapshot\n\nTo capture memory snapshot\n$ java -jar [yourkit_profiler_directory]/lib/yjp-controller-api-redist.jar hostname port capture-memory-snapshot\n\nTo stop profiling, run:\n$ java -jar [yourkit_profiler_directory]/lib/yjp-controller-api-redist.jar hostname port stop-cpu-profiling`\n$ java -jar [yourkit_profiler_directory]/lib/yjp-controller-api-redist.jar hostname port stop-monitor-profiling\nIf memory profiling was turned on,s top it using the following command\n$ java -jar [yourkit_profiler_directory]/lib/yjp-controller-api-redist.jar hostname port stop-alloc-recording\n\nOnce you're done profiling, run the following so that on the next GoCD server restart, the agent is not loaded into the JVM.\nIn case of linux, run the following command:\n$ sudo rm /usr/lib/yourkit/libyjpagent.so\n\n\nIn case of windows, delete the file C:\\yjpagent.dll. If you were using the variable YOURKIT_PATH, then remove the environment variable.\nThese snapshots will be saved in the yourkit configured snapshots folder. They can be sent to the GoCD Support so that they can be examined to help find the root cause of the performance.\nContact GoCD Support\nIf the GoCD server continues to behave poorly, send us the following data.\n\nDatabase file cruise.h2.db. Stop the server and take a backup of the database. Location:\nLinux: /var/lib/db/h2db/cruise.h2.db\nWindows: [go_installation_dir]\\db\\h2db\\cruise.h2.db\n\nLog file go-server.log. Location:\nLinux: /var/log/go-server/go-server.log\nWindows: [go_installation_dir]\\go-server.log\n\nGoCD config file cruise-config.xml. Location:\nLinux: /etc/go/cruise-config.xml\nWindows: [go_installation_dir]\\config\\cruise-config.xml\n\nIf any Yourkit and jconsole snapshots as mentioned in the previous points, its useful if that can be sent too.\n\n\n"},"installation/hardware_specifications.html":{"url":"installation/hardware_specifications.html","title":"Hardware Specifications","summary":"Depending on current needs or expansion plans, GoCD hardware specifications depend on a number of factors and require some experimentation.","keywords":"","body":"GoCD hardware specifications\n\n\nAgent hardware requirements\nServer hardware requirements\nNumber of web-requests to the server\nNumber of agents connected to a GoCD server, and how often they build\nNumber of source control materials\nType of source control materials, some types perform better than others\nNumber of times each of the pipeline has run (pipeline history)\nNumber and types of plugins that may be installed\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions\nCores\nMemory\nIOPS\nIO throughput\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: This page is still a work in progress. Please report issues and provide feedback at https://github.com/gocd/docs.go.cd/issues/76\n\nThe hardware specifications for a GoCD server depends on a number of factors, this makes it difficult to estimate upfront the required hardware specifications and requires a bit of experimentation. The hardware specifications will depend on the current needs and future expansion plans.\nAgent hardware requirements\nThe agent hardware requirements are basically determined by the builds that are run. Running GoCD agents will introduce a slight CPU overhead (usually it can be neglected when comparing to the build process CPU requirements). The agent will require an additional memory of about 500Mb. Although, you may run the agent on the same machine as the server, it is recommended that you use a separate machine (though, it may be virtual) for each build agent. If you chose to install several agents on the same machine, please consider possible CPU, disk, memory or network bottlenecks that might occur.\nServer hardware requirements\nThe GoCD Server is responsible for performing a number of tasks and we describe how each of these tasks affects the specifications:\n\nNumber of web-requests to the server\nNumber of agents connected to a GoCD server, and how often they build\nNumber of source control materials\nType of source control materials, some types perform better than others\nNumber of times each of the pipeline has run (pipeline history)\nNumber and types of plugins that may be installed\n\nNumber of web-requests to the server\nWeb-requests to the server come from different kinds of sources\n\nbrowsers requests from end users (most pages in GoCD continuously poll the server every few seconds to check if the page has updates on it)\nAPI calls from programs\nCCTray which is popularly used by dashboard apps and other desktop apps to notify devs about failing builds usually poll every few seconds and are fairly expensive calls on the server\n\nGoCD uses a shared thread-pool to manage a lot of web requests from several users, if you have a lot of users, consider adding more cores based on the number and type of request you serve per minute.\nYou can find out the number of requests that your server is handling by turning on web-request logging.\nNumber of agents connected to a GoCD server, and how often they build\nEach GoCD agent that is connected to the server will poll the GoCD server every few seconds and to update its status on the server and check if there are any jobs that it should build.\nWhen a build starts off on an agent, it will first perform an SCM checkout operation to update to the correct revision that must be built. If the job requires that artifacts from other dependent jobs be downloaded, the agent will download the artifacts from the server. During a job run, the agent will send the console logs every few seconds and at the end of the build, an agent may upload artifacts to the server if it is configured to do so.\nTo cope up with the number of agents, artifact uploads and downloads, ensure that the server has —\n\nenough disk space to store the artifacts\nenough consistent IO baseline throughput to be able to handle simultaneous uploads and downloads from several agents at the same time\nenough cores to be able to handle web requests from agents\n\n\nNote: it is perfectly allright to host the GoCD artifacts on a network file share. However ensure that your network file share can provide a consistent IO throughput. A high load on the network file share may also cause your web-requests to slow down, if they use the same network port.\n\nIt helps with quicker artifact upload and download if the server and agents are geographically co-located. This will help reduce the latency between the agent and server.\nNumber of source control materials\nGoCD uses up-to 10 processes (configurable) to check if updates are available for source control materials(SCM). Only materials that have polling turned on will be polled. Each material is checked approximately every minute for to see if there are updates available so that GoCD can trigger a build.\nIf you have hundreds of SCMs, depending on the performance of your source control updates, the update checks for SCMs may queue up and negatively affect the performance.\nEnsure that —\n\nyour SCM server(s) can handle the load of several SCM checkout and update operations (both from the server and the agent)\nthere is enough IOPS, IO throughput, memory and cores available to ensure that you can poll all your SCMs without the update checks queueing up, or eating away too many resources that would otherwise be used by the GoCD server process.\n\nYou can find out the amount of time it takes to perform an SCM update check by turning on performance logging on your GoCD server.\nIf you find that material updates are taking too much of your CPU time, you may try one or more of these options —\n\nturn off polling for materials that don't update frequently\nreduce the interval between polls\nnotify the GoCD server of material updates, instead of polling it\ninvestigate if upgrading the SCM software version resolves the issue\n\nType of source control materials, some types perform better than others\nAll SCMs need to connect to a remote SCM repository to check if updates are available. Some of them are more efficient at update checks than others.\nSCMs like git and mercurial require a local clone to be able to check if there are new commits and the contents of those commits, as such they will have additional overhead in terms of IO and disk space usage.\nOn the other hand, SCMs like SVN and TFS don't require a local checkout to check for updates, so they may not have a disk IO overhead on the gocd server. However the number and frequency of since a material update check may cause a bottleneck on the network.\nNumber of times each of the pipeline has run (pipeline history)\nEach pipeline run (along with the stages and jobs in it) is recorded in the database for purpose of audits. To ensure optimal performance of your GoCD server we recommend that you run your database server on a separate instance\nNumber and types of plugins that may be installed\nEach plugin that is installed on the server will consume additional memory on the memory and may have an impact on the CPU utilization of the server. Task plugins, will consume additional on the memory usage of the gocd agent process and may affect the CPU usage of the gocd agent process.\nThis may require that users change the heap(-Xmx) and/or metaspace(-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize).\nDefinitions\nFor the purpose of the rest of this document, we would like to use the following definitions:\nCores\nThe number of physical compute units available to the server machine.\n\nA note about hyper-threading: While hyper-threading makes a single physical core to look like 2 logical cores, the performance improvement, in most cases, the performance is somewhere around 15% of a single core.\n\nMemory\nJVM Memory\nThe amount of memory available to the JVM running the GoCD server process (roughly the -Xmx JVM argument)\nRAM\nThe amount of memory available to the server machine. Generally speaking, the amount of RAM should be atleast 2-3GB more than the JVM memory to allow some headroom for the operating system.\n\nA note about swap: Ensure that swap is turned off, because it negatively affects performance when the machine runs out of memory and begins swapping\n\nBuffer Cache\nReading from a disk is very slow as compared to reading from memory. Additionally, it is common to read the same part of a disk several times during relatively short periods of time. For example, consider how often the command git might be run on a GoCD server. By reading the information from disk only once and then keeping it in memory until no longer needed, one can speed up all but the first read. This is called disk buffering, and the memory used for the purpose is called the buffer cache.\nGenerally speaking, you should ensure that there is sufficient free memory for buffer cache to ensure optimal performance and reduced disk IO.\n[root@fmtgocdgo01 ~]# free -m\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:         11912      11633        278          0         20       2128\n-/+ buffers/cache:       9484       2427\nSwap:            0          0          0\nIn the example above, the first line says that the amount of free memory is \"278\" mb, this makes it look like the system is running short of memory. However the second line(-/+ buffers/cache) shows that in reality 2427 mb is actually free. This is because about 20+2128 megs of memory is buffers + cache, which the OS can purge if it is programs request for more memory.\nIOPS\nThe amount of input/output operations per seconds of your storage device.\nIO throughput\nUsually expressed as Megabytes / Second (MB/s), indicates the amount of data that a server can read and/or write in a given amount of time. Usually, higher the IOPS, the higher the throughput.\n"},"installation/troubleshooting.html":{"url":"installation/troubleshooting.html","title":"Troubleshooting","summary":"Troubleshooting GoCD server and agent installation errors.","keywords":"","body":"GoCD Troubleshooting issues\nThis page is mainly for newer users of GoCD, to help with troubleshooting issues.\n\nGoCD Agent not registering with the GoCD Server\nCommand not found (git, svn, mvn, ant or others)\nAgent is not being assigned or \"Nothing gets built\"\nMac OS X - Message related to Java 1.7\nUnrecognized VM option \"MaxMetaSpaceSize\"\nUnsupported major.minor version 52.0\nGoCD SPA Pages - There was an unknown error performing the operation.

If so, once one of them becomes free, then this build\nwill start.\n\nIf you do see available agents, then check whether the job has resources\ndefined in its config. If so, it means that the job is looking for an agent\nwith those resources. Check the \"Agents\" page to see whether there are agents\nwhich have the resources needed by the job and are available (not building).\n\nIf the previous two options don't solve the problem, check whether the\npipeline is a part of an environment (in the \"Environments\" page or in the\nconfig). If it is, then any agent that can pick up a job from that pipeline\nneeds to be a part of that environment as well.\n\n\n\nMac OS X - Message related to Java 1.7\nIf you were greeted with a message such as this, when trying to use GoCD on Mac OSX:\n\n  \n\n\nyou might have a Java installation in either a non-standard location or older\nthan Java 1.7.

Now, if we need to create another pipeline called \"app-1.0-branch\" which builds 1.0 version of the application, we can use Pipeline Templates as follows\nUsing Administration UI\n\nCreate a template \"my-app-build\" by extracting it from the pipeline \"app-trunk\", as shown in the previous section.\nCreate a new pipeline \"app-1.0-branch\" which defines SCM material with the branch url and uses the template \"my-app-build\".\n\nUsing XML\nPower users can configure the above as follows:\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nEditing Pipeline Templates\nGo Administrators can now enable any Go user to edit a template by making them a template administrator.\nTemplate administrators can view and edit the templates to which they have permissions, on the template tab of the admin page.

However sometimes you don't want the next stage to be triggered automatically. This might be the case if you have a stage that deploys your application to a testing, staging or production environment. Another case can be when you don't want your pipeline to be automatically triggered by changes in version control. In these situations, you want the stage triggered by manual intervention. This can be done through manual approvals.\nIf you add a manual approval to the first stage in a pipeline, it will prevent the pipeline from being triggered from version control. Instead, it will only pick up changes when you trigger the pipeline manually (this is sometimes known as \"forcing the build\").\nYou can control who can trigger manual approvals. See the section on Adding authorization to approvals for more details.\nManaging pipeline groups\nThere is support for collecting multiple pipelines into a single named group. See the section on Specifying who can view and operate pipeline groups for more details.\n"},"configuration/managing_dependencies.html":{"url":"configuration/managing_dependencies.html","title":"Managing Dependencies","summary":"Managing dependencies in GoCD","keywords":"","body":"Managing dependencies\nSometimes you need more complex triggers than a simple pipeline of stages and jobs. In particular, you may want a pipeline to trigger based on the result of a stage in another pipeline. This is possible by adding pipelines as materials.\nCreating a dependency\nSay we have two pipelines - upstream_pipeline and downstream_pipeline . We want downstream_pipeline to automatically trigger following the successful completion of the stage AutoStage1 in pipeline upstream_pipeline. Here's how we'd achieve this:\n\nNavigate to the Admin section.\nOn the Pipelines screen, locate the downstream_pipeline    pipeline and Edit it.\nClick on the Materials tab.\nAdd a new pipeline dependency material by clicking Add Material and then selecting Pipeline .\nYou'll be presented with an Add Material popup (see screenshot)\nEnter upstream_pipeline [AutoStage1] in the Pipeline [stage] field (it can also auto-complete)\n\n\nPower users can also configure this via the Config XML tab on the Admin section (Configuration reference is here):\n\n  \n    \n  \n  ...\n\n\nNow, when the stage \"AutoStage1\" of \"upstream_pipeline\" completes, the pipeline \"downstream_pipeline\" will start building. The Pipeline Dependency visualization shows you all the downstream instances that were triggered off the upstream instance (label 14) currently being viewed.\n\nIf you want to view the materials that are associated with \"downstream_pipeline\", the pipeline details page for that specific instance of the downstream pipeline will show you all this information.\n\nFetching artifacts from an upstream pipeline\nGoCD can automatically fetch artifacts from a previous stage of the current pipeline or from any ancestor pipeline it depends on. This is useful when a pipeline depends on binaries that are produced earlier in the pipeline.\nNote that you can not specify two (or more) dependencies for the same upstream pipeline.\nFor example, in the following configuration, when the stage \"AutoStage1\" of pipeline \"upstream_pipeline\" passes, the pipeline \"downstream_pipeline\" starts, and the artifacts are fetched from the upstream pipeline in the stage 'Stage' of \"downstream_pipeline\". You can see the exact pipeline and stage that triggered this in the sub-tab 'Materials' on the stage details page.\nYou can do this via the admin screens for the respective pipelines. You'll need to first define the artifact in the \"upstream_pipeline\" at the job level:\n\nThen, you'll want to retrieve (fetch) that artifact from within the \"downstream_pipeline.\" You can do this by creating a \"Fetch Artifact\" task within a job in that pipeline. Since you have already defined \"upstream_pipeline\" as a dependency material, artifacts from that pipeline are accessible in this pipeline.\n\nA fetch task can also be instructed to retrieve (fetch) an artifact from an ancestor pipeline. For example, lets assume that the \"upstream_pipeline\" used in this example, depends on another pipeline \"topmost_pipeline\". Then you can define a a \"Fetch Artifact\" task to fetch artifacts from \"topmost_pipeline\" by defining the hierarchy of these pipelines as follows. You have to specify the hierarchy by separting the pipelines with a /. For example: topmost_pipeline/upstream_pipeline.\n\nFor power users, here's how you can configure this via the Config XML tab on the Admin section (Configuration reference is here):\n\n  \n    \n  \n  ...\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n      \n    \n   \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n    \n  \n  ...\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n      \n    \n   \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n   \n  \n  ...\n\n\n"},"configuration/managing_a_build_cloud.html":{"url":"configuration/managing_a_build_cloud.html","title":"Managing Agents","summary":"Managing GoCD agents","keywords":"","body":"Managing GoCD agents\nGoCD is designed to make managing a build cloud extremely simple. This page takes you through the lifecycle of expanding your cloud and maintaining your agents.\nAdding a GoCD agent to your cloud\nThe first thing you need to do is install Go agent on the machine you want to add to the cloud.\nOnce the GoCD agent has been installed and pointed at your GoCD server, go to the Agents tab on the GoCD dashboard. You should see something like this:\n\nNote that the hostname is as reported by the agent, and the IP address is as reported by the server.\nTo add the agent to the cloud, click \"Enable\". Note that even after you have clicked \"Enable\", the agent will not be enabled until it next contacts the server -- so if your agent has stopped talking to the server, nothing will happen.\nOnce your agent has successfully been enabled, it should no longer appear greyed out and will and be marked \"idle\". At this point your agent will automatically begin picking up jobs. Agents will automatically check out any code they need in order to start running jobs.\nMatching jobs to agents\nIn its default state, GoCD server will assign scheduled jobs to the first available agent. GoCD doesn't have the ability to determine what operating system or other resources are present on a given agent. If you want particular jobs to run on particular agents, you'll need to specify resources .\nYou can specify one or more resources that a particular job needs in order to execute. In the same way, you can specify that an agent has one or more resources. Go will then match jobs to agents, such that a job will only run on agents which have at least the resources required for that job.\nResources are just plain text tags. There are no preset tags or conventions around tagging -- just use what makes sense to you. You might, for example, use operating systems as tags: \"RHEL linux\", \"Windows XP\". You could also use browsers, databases, or whatever else makes sense. We recommend you let your classification be driven by your jobs -- if you know that certain jobs will only work on certain machines, tag the jobs with the special resource or resources that job needs in order to work, and then classify the agents accordingly.\n\nNote: Resource matching is case-insensitive.\n\nTo specify the resources that a job needs, go to the Pipelines configuration section of the Administration tab and edit the job that you want to specify resources for:\n\nOnce you’ve specified the resources your jobs need, you’ll want to describe the resources your agents have. You can do this very easily in the Agents tab. Just select the agents you want to describe, and click on the Resources button.\nAssociate selected agent(s) with a newly created resource\nEnter the name of the new resource and click the “Add” button.\n\nAssociate selected agent(s) with existing resources\nAll existing resources across your agents and jobs will appear in alphabetical order. Select one of three states for all resources you want to associate and then click the “Apply” button.\n\nA resource with a check will add the resource to all selected agents.\nA resource with a hyphen means some of your selected agents are associated to it. No change will occur after clicking “Apply”.\nA resource without a check will remove the resource from all selected agents.\n\n\nAgent states\nGoCD will tell you if it loses touch with agents. If GoCD server doesn't hear from an agent for two minutes, the agent will turn red in the Agents tab, and GoCD will tell you the last time it heard from the agent. GoCD will also transparently re-assign the build to the next available agent that can run it, if the lost agent was building a job.\nGoCD will also let you know if one of the agents it knows about has never contacted it since GoCD server was last started. In this case, the agent's state will be marked as \"missing\" and it will be gray.\nIf an agent is working on a job, it will turn orange, and display the name of the job it is working on. You can click on the job description to go to the job details page for that job:\nRemoving agents\nIf you want to remove an agent from GoCD's build cloud, go to the agents tab, locate the agent you want to remove, and click on the button marked \"Disable\". GoCD will record in its configuration that this agent should be excluded from the build cloud. If you restart Go server, the agent will continue to be disabled. Disabled agents do not count towards GoCD's licensed agents.\nTo permanently remove an agent from Go's configuration, you can use the agent api or delete from the agents tab. The agent must be disabled before it can be deleted\nFollowing this procedure, if you restart the agent, GoCD server will see it as a new agent, and you can enable it again in the same way as described above.\n\nPausing agents\nIf you want to pause an agent or temporarily disable it so that GoCD server will not assign work to the agent. GoCD will record in its configuration file that the agent has been disabled. This means, if you restart GoCD server, the disabled agent will remain disabled. You can use the following api to disable agents or you can disable the agent from the agents tab.\nA disabled agent can be enabled; this will make it eligible to pick up work again. You can use the api or enable an agent from the agents tab.\n\nDetails of a single agent\nGoCD now provides a page that shows the details of a single agent. This page provides details about the agent configuration and the history of all the jobs that ran on that agent.\nAgent Details tab\nThis tab shows the configuration and runtime information of an agent. For example, this tab shows the free space available on the agent, the IP Address and the OS of the agent.\nIn terms of configuration, this tab shows the resources of the agent and the environment it belongs to. A sample Details tab looks as below:\n\nJob Run History tab\nYou must be logged in as an admin user to configure this step.\nThis tab shows a table of all the completed jobs that ran on this agent. A sample page is shown below\n\nFor every job, the following columns are shown:\n\nPipeline: The pipeline to which the job belongs to\nStage: The stage to which the job belongs to\nJob: The name of the job\nResult: The result of the job - Passed, Failed, Cancelled or Rescheduled\nCompleted: The date when the Job completed\nDuration: The duration that the Job took to finish - from scheduled till completed.\n\nThe job listing table can be sorted on any column, except for the Duration column.\nUsing Agent details to debug agent issues\nThis page is useful to figure out if there are agent issues and hence a certain job keeps failing on that agent.\nConsider a job which runs functional tests for a web application that need a browser to be available. The job was passing so far and only recently it has started to fail intermittently. Here are the steps you can follow to figure out if this is an agent issue.\n\nNavigate to the Job Details page of the given job that failed.\nLocate the \"Agent\" label and click on the link to the agent\nNavigate to the \"Job Run History\" tab\nSort on the Job Name and locate the job that just navigated from\n\nYou'd notice that the job started to fail recently. You can even see if there are other jobs that have started failing around the same time by now sorting on the Completed date.\n"},"configuration/managing_environments.html":{"url":"configuration/managing_environments.html","title":"Managing Environments","summary":"Managing environments","keywords":"","body":"Managing environments\nGoCD is configured using an XML configuration file.

You can also edit the full XML file if you wish, by clicking on the Config XML section of the Administration tab.\nCreating a new environment\nAn Environment is a grouping of pipelines and agents. By assigning an agent to an environment, it will be used to run only those jobs that belong to the pipelines of that environment. An agent can belong to more than one environment. This means, for instance, the same agent can be used to deploy something into an UAT or a Performance testing environment. A pipeline can, however, only be assigned to a single environment. Generally, these pipelines represent the tasks that need to happen in a given environment. For example deploying a 3-tier application into an UAT environment with 6 machines and running smoke tests on the setup.\nHowever, once an agent is associated with one or more environments, it is no longer capable of picking up jobs on pipelines that do not belong to environments. Pipelines outside of environments will only be assigned to agents in the default pool (not associated with any environment).\nYou can create an environment in the admin UI through the following steps. This example creates a production environment, adding the deployment pipeline and the agent installed on the production server.\n\nClick on the Environments tab\n\n\n\nClick on the \"Add a new environment\"\n\n\n\nProvide a name for the environment\n\n\n\nAdd one or more pipelines that need to run on the environment\n\n\n\nAdd one or more agents associated with the environment\n\n\n\nAdd one or more environment variables or secure environment variables that need to be passed.\n\n\n\nClick on finish\n\nSetting up an environment through the xml can be found in the configuration reference\nAdd a new agent to an existing environment\nYou can do this very easily in the Agents tab.

In this example, user \"aantony\" is being added to the role \"analyst\"\n\nFor power users, here's how you would configure roles via \"Config XML\":\n\n  \n    \n    \n      \n\n      \n        \n          \n            dyang\n            pavan\n          \n        \n        \n           \n            jhumble\n            qiao\n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n        go_admin\n        chris\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nIn this example, the \"qa\" role has two users: dyang and pavan. The \"go_admin\" role also has two users: jhumble and qiao.\nSpecifying permissions for pipeline groups\nGoCD allows you to group pipelines together. If you define pipeline groups, you can specify who is able to view or operate those groups. To do this, you configure permissions to the pipeline group. System administrators will continue to have full access to the pipeline group even if they have not been explicitly granted permissions.\nThe \"view\" permission allows users to view the pipeline. It does not give permission to trigger pipelines, approve stages, or re-run stages. In the below example, the users \"akrishna\" and \"aantony\" can view the pipelines in this group, but they cannot perform any operations on it.\nThe \"operate\" permission allows users to trigger pipelines and its stages. In the below example, the role \"developer\" is being granted the operate permission and will be able to trigger pipelines and its stages within this group.\nThe \"admin\" permission makes the user a Pipeline Group Administrator allowing him to view, operate and administer the pipeline group. In the below example, role \"admins\" has been granted this permission.\n\nNote that is is possible to give a user or role only the operate permission. In the example below, the user \"bot\" only has operate permission. That means they can not view the pipeline, they can only operate it. This can be used to enable a script to operate on pipelines via the APIs without letting that user access any other features of Go.\n\nTo edit the permissions for a pipeline group, navigate to the \"Pipelines\" tab on the \"Admin\" section:\n\nThen, click the \"Edit\" link for the pipeline group you want to manage permissions for:\n\nIf no authorization is defined for a pipeline group, all GoCD users will have view and operate permissions to that group.\nFor power users, here's how you would configure permissions via \"Config XML\":\n\n  \n    \n      aantony\n      akrishna\n      developer\n    \n    \n      bot\n      developer\n    \n    \n      admins\n    \n  \n  ...\n\n\nAdding authorization to approvals\nIn GoCD, it is possible to specify manual approvals between stages. You can also specify which user is allowed to trigger manual approvals.\nThe authorization can be inherited from the pipeline group this pipeline belongs to. But defining specific permissions overrides this. In the example below, only members of the role \"admin\", and the user \"goleys\", can trigger the approval.\n\nFor power users, here's how you would configure authorization for approvals for a stage via \"Config XML\":\n\n\n  \n    \n      admin\n      goleys\n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        uat\n      \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nSpecifying permissions for templates\nA GoCD Administrator can make any user a template administrator for a specific template. As a template administrator, a user can now view and edit the template to which he has permissions.\nTo edit the permissions for a template, navigate to the \"Templates\" tab on the \"Admin\" section:\n\nThen, click the \"Permissions\" link for the template you want to manage permissions for:\n\nFor power users, here's how you would configure permissions via \"Config XML\":\n\n    \n      \n        \n          operate\n        \n      \n      ...\n    \n  \n\nAlso See\n\nDelegating group administration\n\n"},"configuration/delegating_group_administration.html":{"url":"configuration/delegating_group_administration.html","title":"Delegating Group Administration","summary":"Delegating group administration in GoCD","keywords":"","body":"Delegating Group Administration\nA GoCD Administrator can authorize users and roles to be administrators for Pipeline Groups.

Access to a windowing environment is usually required for testing UI applications or for driving browsers for web testing. Here's how you do it.\nWindows\nThe first step is to disable the GoCD agent service. To do this:\n\nLog in to your Windows machine as an Administrative user.\nClick on Start → Control Panel → Administrative Tools → Services.\nDouble click on 'Go Agent'.\nChange the Startup Type to 'Disabled'.\nClick 'Stop' to stop the service.\nClick 'OK' to finish.\n\nThe next step is to start the Go agent as an application.\n\nClick on Start → All Programs → Go Agent → Run Go Agent.\nTo get the Go agent to start every time you log in, copy the Run Go Agent shortcut to the Startup folder of your start menu.\n\nLinux\nThere are many different ways to get a Linux build agent to interact with a UI. The easiest is to use a VNC service to provide a dedicated X11 server to your agent. To do this:\n\nInstall the VNC server and fvwm packages for your distribution. (aptitude install vnc4server fvwm / yum install vnc-server fvwm)\nSudo to the 'go' user (sudo su - go) and do the rest as that user\nSet a password for remote access to your VNC server with the command 'vncpasswd'\nEdit your VNC config to use fvwm and not twm as the window manager. (replace twm with fvwm in ~/.vnc/xstartup)\nEdit '/etc/default/go-agent' and change the line 'VNC=N' to 'VNC=Y'\n\nRestart your agent and it will now have access to an X11 server that you can also connect to with your favourite VNC client. The default DISPLAY that Go uses is :3\n\n\nIf there are any other environmental variables that need to be set for your UI testing tools, they correct place to set these is in your /etc/default/go-agent file. Don't forget to export them!\nYou can connect to your session with vncviewer to see what's going on.

The TFS SDK is packaged with GoCD; no additional configuration is required.\nUsers can continue to use GoCD with TFS 2012, 2013, 2015 and Visual Studio Team Services.\nYou will need to configure the following to add a TFS material:\n\nMaterial Name: An optional name for the material. This name can be used to set the TFS revision in the pipeline label.\nURL: Set the url for the TFS collection. Ex: http://41.42.43.44:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection\nDomain: Domain name for TFS authentication credentials. Should be domain for the TFS account. Ex: corporate_thoughtworks\nUsername: The user has to be a collection administrator for the TFS collection used in URL.\nPassword: Provide the password for the TFS account\nProject Path: Enter the project path within the collection. You can specify paths of sub folders to create materials for each component. Ex: $/test/component or $/my_application\nCheck connection: You can use check connection to verify the TFS material configuration\n\n\nNotes:\n\nGoCD will map TFS projects to destination folders within the GoCD agent installation directories. You can identify mappings by looking at the destination folders.\nIn this release, GoCD does not delete any workspace it has created. Workspace names are generated internally.\nIf possible, create a new user account on TFS which will be used for creating TFS materials in GoCD. You can use this account to easily identify TFS workspaces that GoCD created on the server and agents.\nIf you are using the cross platform command line client, you cannot run the GoCD server and GoCD agent as a service on the local system account. You will need to run the service with a user account which has accepted the eula for the client.\nIf at any point, you need to change the go server installation to a different location or machine, you will need to manually delete the old tfs mappings at the old GoCD server location.\n\nKnown Caveats\n\nIf TFS server is accessed using HTTPS and the SSL certificate is an untrusted certificate then the certificate must be added to the trust store of the Java installation used to launch the GoCD server and agents. Untrusted certificate will not be trusted by default GoCD server and agents.\nDuring the TFS checkout process, if one of the file paths exceeds 259 characters - checkout will fail.So care should be taken when specifying the destination directory so that the path limit is not exceeded. GoCD agent installation directory also plays a part in both cases where destination directory is specified and when its not.\nOn all the agents prior to checkout from TFS, entire mapped directory is cleaned and -all option is used for checkout. As a result there is increased load on TFS server and network bandwidth consumption is high during the process. This is an issue that will be addressed in subsequent releases.\nKerberos support for TFS authentication has not been verified.\nCurrently, GoCD always does a tfs get to retrieve the latest changes on the agents.\n\n"},"configuration/configuration_reference.html":{"url":"configuration/configuration_reference.html","title":"Reference","summary":"GoCD configuration reference

information and attributes of the Go Server.\nAttributes\n\n\n\nAttribute\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nartifactsdir\nNo\nThis directory is where Go will store its information, including artifacts published by jobs. The default value is 'artifacts' in the folder where the Go Server is installed. You can use an absolute path or a relative path which will take the server installed directory as the root. Notes: If you specify the attribute, please check whether Go has permission to access that directory. Also you should be aware of that changing this value while Go Server is running won't take effect until Go Server is restarted.\n\n\nsiteUrl\nNo\nThis entry will be used by Go Server to generate links for emails, feeds etc., where we cannot have relative URLs. For example, if you have fronted Go with a reverse proxy, this value should be the base URL for the proxy and not the internal Go address. For this reason, it is necessary to specify this configuration. Format: [protocol]://[host]:[port]. You need to define the [port] in case Go uses a non-standard port.\n\n\nsecureSiteUrl\nNo\nCertain features in Go, such as Mingle integration, require an HTTPS(SSL) endpoint. If you wish that your primary site URL be HTTP, but still want to have HTTPS endpoints for the features that require SSL, you can specify the secureSiteUrl attribute with a value of the base HTTPS URL. Format: https://[host]:[port]. You need to define the [port] in case Go uses a non-standard port.\n\n\npurgeStart\nNo\nGo can purge old artifacts when available disk space on the server is low. Go will begin to purge artifacts when disk space is lower than 'purgeStart' GB. Artifacts will never be deleted if 'purgeStart' and 'purgeUpto' are not defined.\n\n\npurgeUpto\nNo\nGo can purge old artifacts when available disk space on the server is low. Go will purge artifacts till available disk space is greater than 'purgeUpto' GB. This attribute must be defined if purgeStart is defined.\n\n\njobTimeout\nNo\nThis entry will be used as the default timeout value for hung jobs. A job is considered as hung if it does not generate any console output for \"jobTimeout\" minutes. If the attribute is not specified jobTimeout defaults to 60 minutes.\n\n\ncommandRepositoryLocation\nYes (auto-generated)\nSpecifies the location of the command repository relative to go-server_install_root/db/command_repository. The bundled repository is in a directory named default.\n\n\nserverId\nYes (auto-generated)\nThis value uniquely identifies a Go server installation. It may be used by features that require unique names/identifiers across different Go server installations. This attribute need not be specified for a new server. In case no value is given, server auto-generates a random UUID an assigns it as serverId. This value should never be changed for an existing server. Administrator should clear this attribute before copying configuration to a different installation.\n\n\nagentAutoRegisterKey\nNo\nThe key specified here is used by agents for auto-registration.\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\nIf both siteUrl and secureSiteUrl are not defined, Go URLs will use the default domain which in most cases will be http://your-go-server:8153\nIf only siteUrl is defined and is not HTTPS, Go URLs will be composed from the siteUrl entry. In this case, the secure pages of Go will not be navigable.\nIf only siteUrl is defined and is HTTPS, Go URLs will be composed from the siteUrl entry and all pages will be HTTPS.\nIf only secureSiteUrl is defined, Go URLs will use the default domain for non-HTTPS pages, while HTTPs pages will be composed from the secureSiteUrl entry.\nIf purgeStart and purgeUpto are not defined, artifacts will never be deleted.\n\nExamples\n\n  \n  \n\n\ntop\n \nThe  element can be used to enable authentication. If the element is not defined anyone can use Go without logging in. We currently support enabling authentication using Authorization plugin endpoint. Support for LDAP and simple password-file authentication is available out of box via the bundled plugins for the same. You can use more than one authentication mechanism if you want. Support for inbuilt LDAP and password file tags in configuration has been deprecated.\nAttributes\n\n\n\nAttribute\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nallowOnlyKnownUsersToLogin\nNo\nAllow only those users to login who have been explicitly added by an admin. If false, any new user who tries to login and is present in your password file or LDAP will be automatically created as a Go user. (Default=false)\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n  \n    \n     \n       \n         Url\n         ldap://xxx.yourcompany.com\n       \n       \n         ManagerDN\n         cn=Acitivity Directory LDap User,ou=InformationSystems,ou=SharedAccounts,ou=Principal,dc=xxxx,dc=yyyy,dc=com\n       \n       \n         Password\n         secret\n       \n       \n         SearchBases\n         ou=Employees,ou=Enterprise,ou=Principal,dc=xxxx,dc=yyyy,dc=com\n       \n       \n         UserLoginFilter\n         (sAMAccountName={0})\n       \n       \n         UserSearchFilter\n         (sAMAccountName={0})\n       \n       \n         DisplayNameAttribute\n         displayName\n       \n       \n         EmailAttribute\n         mail\n       \n     \n   \n  \n\n\ntop\n \nThe  element is used to configure mail notifications. Mail notifications require security to be enabled.\n\n\n\nAttribute\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nhostname\nYes\nThe SMTP mail server which Go will use to send email. For example, hostname=\"mailhost.yourcompany.com\"\n\n\nport\nYes\nThe mail port to use. Typically this will be the default mail port of 25.\n\n\nusername\nYes\nThe username which Go should use to login to the mail host.\n\n\npassword\nYes\nThe password to access the mailhost.\n\n\ntls\nNo\nUse TLS(Transport Layer Security) or not. The default value is 'false'. Use 'true' to enable TLS security.\n\n\nfrom\nYes\nGo will attempt to set this email address as the 'from' address for email that it sends. Note that this setting may not be honoured by the SMTP server that you use. For example, from=\"go-admin@yourcompany.com\".\n\n\nadmin\nYes\nGo admintrator's email address. Go will send diagnostic messages to this email address. For example, Go will send a warning message if it is running out of disk space.\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\ntop\n \nThe  element is used to configure backups.\n\n\n\nAttribute\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nschedule\nNo\nThe cron-like specification to perform a backup.\n\n\npostBackupScript\nNo\nA script that will be invoked on the GoCD server after backup is performed (successfully, or otherwise). See cron backups for details about this script.\n\n\nemailOnSuccess\nNo\nBoolean indicating whether email should be sent on a successful backup. Requires that mailhost config be setup.\n\n\nemailOnFailure\nNo\nBoolean indicating whether email should be sent on a failed backup backup. Requires that mailhost config be setup.\n\n\n\nExamples\nFor example: to perform a backup once a night at 10pm on weekdays and call the /usr/local/bin/upload-to-s3 script after the backup is done.\n\n  \n  ...\n\n\nGo uses the Quartz scheduler internally. For convenience we reproduce the Quartz cron documentation here:\nFormat\nA cron expression is a string comprised of 6 or 7 fields separated by white space. Fields can contain any of the allowed values, along with\nvarious combinations of the allowed special characters for that field. The fields are as follows:\n\n\n\nField Name\nMandatory?\nAllowed Values\nAllowed Special Characters\n\n\n\n\nSeconds\nYES\n0-59\n, - * /\n\n\nMinutes\nYES\n0-59\n, - * /\n\n\nHours\nYES\n0-23\n, - * /\n\n\nDay of month\nYES\n1-31\n, - * ? / L W\\\n\n\nMonth\nYES\n1-12 or JAN-DEC\n, - * /\n\n\nDay of week\nYES\n1-7 or SUN-SAT\n, - * ? / L #\n\n\nYear\nNO\nempty, 1970-2099\n, - * /\n\n\n\nSo cron expressions can be as simple as this: * * * * * ? or more complex, like this: 0 15 10 ? * 6L 2002-2005\nSpecial characters\n\n* (\"all values\") - used to select all values within a field. For example, \"*\" in the minute field means \"every minute\".\n\n? (\"no specific value\") - useful when you need to specify something in one of the two fields in which the character is allowed, but not the other. For example, if I want my trigger to fire on a particular day of the month (say, the 10th), but don't care what day of the week that happens to be, I would put \"10\" in the day-of-month field, and \"?\" in the day-of-week field. See the examples below for clarification.\n\n- - used to specify ranges. For example, \"10-12\" in the hour field means \"the hours 10, 11 and 12\".\n\n, - used to specify additional values. For example, \"MON,WED,FRI\" in the day-of-week field means \"the days Monday, Wednesday, and Friday\".\n\n/ - used to specify increments. For example, \"0/15\" in the seconds field means \"the seconds 0, 15, 30, and 45\". And \"5/15\" in the seconds field means \"the seconds 5, 20, 35, and 50\". You can also specify '/' after the '' character - in this case '' is equivalent to having '0' before the '/'. '1/3' in the day-of-month field means \"fire every 3 days starting on the first day of the month\".\n\nL (\"last\") - has different meaning in each of the two fields in which it is allowed. For example, the value \"L\" in the day-of-month field means \"the last day of the month\" - day 31 for January, day 28 for February on non-leap years. If used in the day-of-week field by itself, it simply means \"7\" or \"SAT\". But if used in the day-of-week field after another value, it means \"the last xxx day of the month\" - for example \"6L\" means \"the last friday of the month\". When using the 'L' option, it is important not to specify lists, or ranges of values, as you'll get confusing results.\n\nW (\"weekday\") - used to specify the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest the given day. As an example, if you were to specify \"15W\" as the value for the day-of-month field, the meaning is: \"the nearest weekday to the 15th of the month\". So if the 15th is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Friday the 14th. If the 15th is a Sunday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 16th. If the 15th is a Tuesday, then it will fire on Tuesday the 15th. However if you specify \"1W\" as the value for day-of-month, and the 1st is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 3rd, as it will not 'jump' over the boundary of a month's days. The 'W' character can only be specified when the day-of-month is a single day, not a range or list of days. The 'L' and 'W' characters can also be combined in the day-of-month field to yield 'LW', which translates to \"last weekday of the month\".\n\n# - used to specify \"the nth\" XXX day of the month. For example, the value of \"6#3\" in the day-of-week field means \"the third Friday of the month\" (day 6 = Friday and \"#3\" = the 3rd one in the month). Other examples: \"2#1\" = the first Monday of the month and \"4#5\" = the fifth Wednesday of the month. Note that if you specify \"#5\" and there is not 5 of the given day-of-week in the month, then no firing will occur that month. The legal characters and the names of months and days of the week are not case sensitive. MON is the same as mon.\n\n\nExamples\nHere are some full examples:\n\n\n\nExpression\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n0 0 12 * * ?\nFire at 12pm (noon) every day\n\n\n0 15 10 ? * *\nFire at 10:15am every day\n\n\n0 15 10 * * ?\nFire at 10:15am every day\n\n\n0 15 10 * * ? *\nFire at 10:15am every day\n\n\n0 15 10 * * ? 2005\nFire at 10:15am every day during the year 2005\n\n\n0 * 14 * * ?\nFire every minute starting at 2pm and ending at 2:59pm, every day\n\n\n0 0/5 14 * * ?\nFire every 5 minutes starting at 2pm and ending at 2:55pm, every day\n\n\n0 0/5 14,18 * * ?\nFire every 5 minutes starting at 2pm and ending at 2:55pm, AND fire every 5 minutes starting at 6pm and ending at 6:55pm, every day\n\n\n0 0-5 14 * * ?\nFire every minute starting at 2pm and ending at 2:05pm, every day\n\n\n0 10,44 14 ? 3 WED\nFire at 2:10pm and at 2:44pm every Wednesday in the month of March.\n\n\n0 15 10 ? * MON-FRI\nFire at 10:15am every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday\n\n\n0 15 10 15 * ?\nFire at 10:15am on the 15th day of every month\n\n\n0 15 10 L * ?\nFire at 10:15am on the last day of every month\n\n\n0 15 10 ? * 6L\nFire at 10:15am on the last Friday of every month\n\n\n0 15 10 ? * 6L\nFire at 10:15am on the last Friday of every month\n\n\n0 15 10 ? * 6L 2002-2005\nFire at 10:15am on every last friday of every month during the years 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005\n\n\n0 15 10 ? * 6#3\nFire at 10:15am on the third Friday of every month\n\n\n0 0 12 1/5 * ?\nFire at 12pm (noon) every 5 days every month, starting on the first day of the month.\n\n\n0 11 11 11 11 ?\nFire every November 11th at 11:11am.\n\n\n\nPay attention to the effects of '?' and '*' in the day-of-week and day-of-month fields!\nNotes\n\nSupport for specifying both a day-of-week and a day-of-month value is not complete (you must currently use the '?' character in one of these fields).\nBe careful when setting fire times between mid-night and 1:00 AM - \"daylight savings\" can cause a skip or a repeat depending on whether the time moves back or jumps forward.\n\ntop\n  [Deprecated]\nThe  element is used to specify the ldap server.

Each mapping has two parts:\n\nThe left-hand side specifies one or more files in the depot and has the form: //depotname/file_specification\nThe right-hand side specifies one or more files in the client workspace and has the form: //clientname/file_specification\n\nGo creates a p4 client to check out files into its sandbox with the 'clobber' option set. All other options use default values as defined by Perforce. Client name is generated automatically by Go. Hence, you can use anything as 'clientname' on the right-hand side in view mapping. The client name format is: cruise-[hostname]-[config repo id]-[a random hash code], for example \"cruise-myhostname-configrepo1-wOaJ9kjpfgOLQCncki19ikXt5Q\".\nGo views are in the same format as that used by Perforce itself. In fact you should be able to copy a Perforce view from your existing Perforce\nsetup and paste it into the view section.\nFor example:\n\n    \n      \n    \n\n\ntop\n \nThe config repo  material element specifies the location of your code base in a GIT repository.

Go administrators can define roles and users in the tag.\nUsers and Roles defined as group admins can view and operate on all pipelines in this pipeline group. They are allowed to navigate to the admin page where they can only see and edit this pipeline group which includes creating and modifying pipelines in this group,via the Pipeline Configuration Tab. They have no permission to view or modify the Pipeline Templates even if they are used by any pipeline in this group.\nNote: Go Administrators (admins) defined in security tab, can administer all pipeline groups.\nExamples\nGiven the following configuration only admins, lqiao and any users having the role 'studios_group_admin'.\n\n  ...\n  \n    \n        \n           lqiao\n           studios_group_admin\n        \n    \n    \n    ......\n    \n  \n\n\ntop\n \nThe  element is a permission section to specify who can see the pipelines under the pipeline group. You can define roles and users in the tag.\nNote:Administrators (admins) can see all pipeline groups. Any other users or roles that are not listed under the  tag will be unable to see this pipeline group\nExamples\nGiven the following configuration only administrators can operate the pipeline group, and only admins, lqiao and any users having the role 'go_readonly_member' can see the pipeline.\n\n  ...\n  \n    \n        \n           lqiao\n           go_readonly_member\n        \n    \n    \n    ......\n    \n  \n\n\ntop\n \nThe  element specifies who can operate the pipelines under the pipeline group. You can define roles and users.\nNote:Any users/roles that are not listed under the  tag will be unable to see this pipeline group (even if they are listed as being allowed to  that pipeline group)\nExamples\nGiven the following configuration, only admins, lqiao, jez and the users having the role 'go_core_member' can operate the pipeline group. Only admins, lqiao and the users having the role 'go_readonly_member' can see the pipeline (jez and go_core_member cannot).\n\n  ...\n  \n    \n        \n           lqiao\n           go_readonly_member\n        \n        \n           lqiao\n           jez\n           go_core_member\n        \n    \n    \n    ......\n    \n  \n\n\ntop\n \nThe  element specifies a single pipeline. It must be unique (including case) across the entire configuration (not only in the\npipeline group).\nNotes:\nThere should be at least one stage in one pipeline. Go uses the pipeline name to identify the pipeline. If you change the pipeline name, you will lose the history of the pipeline.\nAttributes\n\n\n\nAttribute\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nname\nYes\nThe name is used to identify a pipeline, so each pipeline name must be unique. Pipeline name can contain the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, fullstop, underscore and hyphen. Spaces are not allowed. Name is case-insensitive in Go and the length should be less than 255 characters.\n\n\nlabeltemplate\nNo\nBoth of material names and ${COUNT} are available in the labeltemplate and the default value of labeltemplate is '${COUNT}'. If you just specify labeltemplate=\"foo-1.0-${COUNT}\", your pipeline will show foo-1.0-1, foo-1.0-2, and so on. When you reference material names in the labeltemplate, Go will use the revisions of the reference materials to populate the pipeline label. For example, given a mateial name is 'svnrepo' in a pipeline, when you specify labeltemplate=\"foo-1.0-${svnrepo}\", then your pipeline would show foo-1.0-3123, foo-1.0-3124, and so on. Material names are case insensitive. The max length of a pipeline label is 255. If a material name is 'svnrepo', the following labeltemplates are valid: ${COUNT}, ${svnrepo}, foo-${COUNT}-${SVNrepo}, foo-${svnrepo}-${COUNT}-bar.\n\n\nlockBehavior\nNo\nThe possible values are \"none\", \"lockOnFailure\" or \"unlockWhenFinished\".The default value is \"none\". When set to \"lockOnFailure\", GoCD ensures that only a single instance of a pipeline can be run at a time and the pipeline will be locked if it fails, unless it is the last stage which fails. When set to \"unlockWhenFinished\", GoCD ensures that only a single instance of a pipeline can be run at a time, and the pipeline will be unlocked as soon as it finishes (success or failure), or reaches a manual stage.\n\n\ntemplate\nNo\nThe name of the template that this pipeline references. If this is set, no stages may be defined in this pipeline.\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n  \n  \n     bar\n   \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n      \n        linux\n      \n      \n        \n      \n    \n      \n    \n  \n\n\ntop\n \nThe element  specifies the list of parameters (Element param) elements to be used in a pipeline or a pipeline template. You can specify these under a  and can be used anywhere inside pipeline/stage/job definition.\ntop\n \nA  defines the parameter name that will be substituted with the paramerter value that will be substituted in a pipeline or a pipeline\ntemplate.\nExample:\n\n    echo\n    /repo/branch\n\n\ntop\n \nThe  element can be used to specify links to an issue tracker. Go will construct a link based on the commit message that you\ncan use to take you to your tracking tool (Mingle card, JIRA issue, Trac issue etc).\nAttributes\n\n\n\nAttribute\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nlink\nYes\na URL with a string '${ID}'. Go will replace the string '${ID}' with the first matched group value at run-time.\n\n\nregex\nYes\nA regex to identify the IDs. Go will find the first matched group in your commit messages and use it to construct the hyper-link.\n\n\n\nExamples\nSuppose you are using a Web Application to manage your tasks or bugs, and the link looks like http://your-trackingtool/yourproject/512, '512'\nis your task ID. Your configuration would be:\n\n  \n  ...\n\n\nIf you check in some code with a commit message which includes the characters 'evo-512' then that will appear in the modification pop-up\nbox as a link. When you click it, Go will take you to the web page 'http://your-trackingtool/yourproject/512'.\nFor example: If you use Mingle for your task manager, the configuration would be:\n\n  \n  ...\n\n\nNotes: You can not define multiple tracking tools in one pipeline.\ntop\n \nThis element let's you associate a Mingle project to a pipeline. Once associated, you will be able to track Mingle cards from within Go.\nNote: You cannot configure a trackingtool if mingle is configured for a pipeline.\nAttributes\n\n\n\nAttribute\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nbaseUrl\nYes\nBase URL to the Mingle installation (do not include the project name/identifier)\n\n\nprojectIdentifier\nYes\nThis is the \"Identifier\" specified under a Mingle project's \"Basic Options\"\n\n\nmqlGroupingConditions\nNo\nAn MQL string that determines the \"passing criteria\" for cards displayed in Go\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n    status > 'In Dev'\n\n\ntop\n \nThe  element specifies a cron-like schedule to build the pipeline.\nAttributes\n\n\n\nAttribute\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nonlyOnChanges\nNo\nSkips scheduling if the previous run of the pipeline was with the latest material(s). This option is typically useful when automatic pipeline scheduling is turned off.\n\n\n\nExamples\nFor example to run a pipeline once a night at 10pm on weekdays:\n\n  0 0 22 ? * MON-FRI\n  ...\n\n\nGo uses the Quartz scheduler internally. For convenience we reproduce the Quartz cron documentation here:\nFormat\nA cron expression is a string comprised of 6 or 7 fields separated by white space. Fields can contain any of the allowed values, along with\nvarious combinations of the allowed special characters for that field. The fields are as follows:\n\n\n\nField Name\nMandatory?\nAllowed Values\nAllowed Special Characters\n\n\n\n\nSeconds\nYES\n0-59\n, - * /\n\n\nMinutes\nYES\n0-59\n, - * /\n\n\nHours\nYES\n0-23\n, - * /\n\n\nDay of month\nYES\n1-31\n, - * ? / L W\\\n\n\nMonth\nYES\n1-12 or JAN-DEC\n, - * /\n\n\nDay of week\nYES\n1-7 or SUN-SAT\n, - * ? / L #\n\n\nYear\nNO\nempty, 1970-2099\n, - * /\n\n\n\nSo cron expressions can be as simple as this: * * * * * ? or more complex, like this: 0 15 10 ? * 6L 2002-2005\nSpecial characters\n\n* (\"all values\") - used to select all values within a field. For example, \"*\" in the minute field means \"every minute\".\n\n? (\"no specific value\") - useful when you need to specify something in one of the two fields in which the character is allowed, but not the other. For example, if I want my trigger to fire on a particular day of the month (say, the 10th), but don't care what day of the week that happens to be, I would put \"10\" in the day-of-month field, and \"?\" in the day-of-week field. See the examples below for clarification.\n\n- - used to specify ranges. For example, \"10-12\" in the hour field means \"the hours 10, 11 and 12\".\n\n, - used to specify additional values. For example, \"MON,WED,FRI\" in the day-of-week field means \"the days Monday, Wednesday, and Friday\".\n\n/ - used to specify increments. For example, \"0/15\" in the seconds field means \"the seconds 0, 15, 30, and 45\". And \"5/15\" in the seconds field means \"the seconds 5, 20, 35, and 50\". You can also specify '/' after the '' character - in this case '' is equivalent to having '0' before the '/'. '1/3' in the day-of-month field means \"fire every 3 days starting on the first day of the month\".\n\nL (\"last\") - has different meaning in each of the two fields in which it is allowed. For example, the value \"L\" in the day-of-month field means \"the last day of the month\" - day 31 for January, day 28 for February on non-leap years. If used in the day-of-week field by itself, it simply means \"7\" or \"SAT\". But if used in the day-of-week field after another value, it means \"the last xxx day of the month\" - for example \"6L\" means \"the last friday of the month\". When using the 'L' option, it is important not to specify lists, or ranges of values, as you'll get confusing results.\n\nW (\"weekday\") - used to specify the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest the given day. As an example, if you were to specify \"15W\" as the value for the day-of-month field, the meaning is: \"the nearest weekday to the 15th of the month\". So if the 15th is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Friday the 14th. If the 15th is a Sunday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 16th. If the 15th is a Tuesday, then it will fire on Tuesday the 15th. However if you specify \"1W\" as the value for day-of-month, and the 1st is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 3rd, as it will not 'jump' over the boundary of a month's days. The 'W' character can only be specified when the day-of-month is a single day, not a range or list of days. The 'L' and 'W' characters can also be combined in the day-of-month field to yield 'LW', which translates to \"last weekday of the month\".\n\n# - used to specify \"the nth\" XXX day of the month. For example, the value of \"6#3\" in the day-of-week field means \"the third Friday of the month\" (day 6 = Friday and \"#3\" = the 3rd one in the month). Other examples: \"2#1\" = the first Monday of the month and \"4#5\" = the fifth Wednesday of the month. Note that if you specify \"#5\" and there is not 5 of the given day-of-week in the month, then no firing will occur that month. The legal characters and the names of months and days of the week are not case sensitive. MON is the same as mon.\n\n\nExamples\nHere are some full examples:\n\n\n\nExpression\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n0 0 12 * * ?\nFire at 12pm (noon) every day\n\n\n0 15 10 ? * *\nFire at 10:15am every day\n\n\n0 15 10 * * ?\nFire at 10:15am every day\n\n\n0 15 10 * * ? *\nFire at 10:15am every day\n\n\n0 15 10 * * ? 2005\nFire at 10:15am every day during the year 2005\n\n\n0 * 14 * * ?\nFire every minute starting at 2pm and ending at 2:59pm, every day\n\n\n0 0/5 14 * * ?\nFire every 5 minutes starting at 2pm and ending at 2:55pm, every day\n\n\n0 0/5 14,18 * * ?\nFire every 5 minutes starting at 2pm and ending at 2:55pm, AND fire every 5 minutes starting at 6pm and ending at 6:55pm, every day\n\n\n0 0-5 14 * * ?\nFire every minute starting at 2pm and ending at 2:05pm, every day\n\n\n0 10,44 14 ? 3 WED\nFire at 2:10pm and at 2:44pm every Wednesday in the month of March.\n\n\n0 15 10 ? * MON-FRI\nFire at 10:15am every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday\n\n\n0 15 10 15 * ?\nFire at 10:15am on the 15th day of every month\n\n\n0 15 10 L * ?\nFire at 10:15am on the last day of every month\n\n\n0 15 10 ? * 6L\nFire at 10:15am on the last Friday of every month\n\n\n0 15 10 ? * 6L\nFire at 10:15am on the last Friday of every month\n\n\n0 15 10 ? * 6L 2002-2005\nFire at 10:15am on every last friday of every month during the years 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005\n\n\n0 15 10 ? * 6#3\nFire at 10:15am on the third Friday of every month\n\n\n0 0 12 1/5 * ?\nFire at 12pm (noon) every 5 days every month, starting on the first day of the month.\n\n\n0 11 11 11 11 ?\nFire every November 11th at 11:11am.\n\n\n\nPay attention to the effects of '?' and '*' in the day-of-week and day-of-month fields!\nNotes\n\nSupport for specifying both a day-of-week and a day-of-month value is not complete (you must currently use the '?' character in one of these fields).\nBe careful when setting fire times between mid-night and 1:00 AM - \"daylight savings\" can cause a skip or a repeat depending on whether the time moves back or jumps forward.\n\ntop\n \nThe  element specifies the source of the pipeline changes. Generally this will be your codebase in your source control repository.\nNotes:\nGo supports multiple materials with the restriction that every material must contain a unique \"dest\" folder (that is not a subfolder of any\nother material). Go will check out the source code into this folder for each material.\nExamples\n\n  \n    \n  \n  ...\n\n\nMultiple materials:\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n      \n    \n  \n  ...\n\n\ntop\n \nThe  element specifies files in changesets that should not trigger a pipeline automatically. When a pipeline is triggered by files that are not ignored the filtered files will still be updated with other files. You can only define one filter under each SCM material. When you trigger a pipeline manually, it will update to most recent revision, including filtered files.\nExamples\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\ntop\n \nThe  element is used to specify a set of files that are ignored when Go checks for changes. Repository changesets which only\ncontain these files will not trigger a pipeline automatically.\nAttributes\n\n\n\nAttribute\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\npattern\nYes\ndefines a pattern (Ant-style) for the files to be ignored. Changes of thoes files will not trigger the pipeline. the pattern is relative to the root of the SCM repository, not the sandbox of the pipeline.\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n can occur multiple times under .\nThe pattern is relative to the root directory of the SCM repository, not the sandbox in the agent side or the materials URL.\nIgnored files are still updated when other files are updated.\n\nExamples:\n\n\nIgnore everything under the folder 'doc'.\n\n\nIgnore files under the folder 'doc', excluding any subfolder.\n\n\nIgnore files that are under the directory 'framework/helper' and the file extension is .doc.\n\n\nIgnore files that are under the root directory of SCM repository and the file extension is .pdf.\n\n\nIgnore all the files that is under any 'helper' folder and the file extension is .pdf.\n\n\nIgnore all the files that are in the nested directory under folder 'helper' of the repository and the file extension is .pdf.\ntop\n \nThe  element specifies the location of your code base in Subversion repository.\nAttributes\n\n\n\nAttribute\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nurl\nYes\nURL for the remote repository. Go supports the following protocols for subversion: http, https, svn and svn+ssh, but does not support 'file:///'.\n\n\nusername\nNo\nThe user account for the remote repository.\n\n\npassword\nNo\nThe password for the specified user\n\n\ncheckexternals\nNo\nThe default value is false, the value should be either one of true/false or 1/0. 'true' or '1' means that the changes of externals will trigger the pipeline automatically.\n\n\ndest\nRequired if there are multiple materials\nThe directory where the code will be checked out. This is relative to the sandbox of the Go Agent. Go prevents the destination folder from being outside the agent's sandbox.\n\n\nmaterialName\nRequired if this material is referenced in pipeline labeltemplate\nThe name to identify a material. Material name can contain the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, fullstop, underscore and hyphen, but whitespace is not allowed. A material name is case insensitive and starting with fullstop is invalid. It needs to be unique within a pipeline. The max length is 255 characters.\n\n\nautoUpdate\nNo\nBy default Go polls the repository for changes automatically. If autoUpdate is set to false then Go will not poll the repository for changes. Instead it will check for changes only when you trigger a pipeline that contains this material or it receives a notification through a post-commit hook. If the same material is specified more than once in the configuration file, all of them must have the same value for autoUpdate.\n\n\ninvertFilter\nNo\nInverts any filter elements, turning them into whitelists. Only files that match the filter will trigger a new build.\n\n\n\nNotes:\nGo cannot automatically accept svn SSL certificates. If you are using https for svn repository, you have to go to the Server and each Agent,\nand as the user 'go' do a command \"svn update\" to store the certificates in the cache permanently.\nExamples:\nFor a Go Agent on linux with the following configuration:\n\n  \n    \n    \n  \n  ...\n\n\nGo Agent will check out source code from 'http://svn-server.com/framework' to '/var/lib/go-agent/pipelines/myproduct/framwork', and from 'http://svn-server.com/componentOne' to '/var/lib/go-agent/pipelines/myproduct/mycomponent'.\ntop\n \nThe  element specifies the location of your code base in a Mercurial repository. Go supports the http and ssh for Mercurial.\nNotes:\nYou must install Mercurial 1.5 or above on the Go Server and Go Agents for the jobs need Mercurial. Go does not ship with Mercurial.\nAttributes\n\n\n\nAttribute\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nurl\nYes\nURL to fetch source code from the Mercurial repository. If you specify the username and password for the Mercurial repository, you should put them into the url. Mercurial supports an optional identifier after # in the url, which indicates a particular branch, tag or changeset. This option can be used to configure mercurial branches in Go.\n\n\ndest\nOnly for multiple materials\nThe directory where the code will be checked out. This is relative to the sandbox of the Go Agent. Go prevents the destination folder from being outside the agent's sandbox.\n\n\nmaterialName\nRequired if this material is referenced in pipeline labeltemplate\nThe name to identify a material. Material name can contain the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, fullstop, underscore and hyphen. Spaces are not allowed. Material name is case insensitive. It needs to be unique within a pipeline. The max length is 255 characters.\n\n\nautoUpdate\nNo\nBy default Go polls the repository for changes automatically. If autoUpdate is set to false then Go will not poll the repository for changes. Instead it will check for changes only when you trigger a pipeline that contains this material. If the same material is specified more than once in the configuration file, all of them must have the same value for autoUpdate.\n\n\ninvertFilter\nNo\nInverts any filter elements, turning them into whitelists. Only files that match the filter will trigger a new build.\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n  \n    \n  \n  ...\n\n\nSpecifying a mercurial branch.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  ...\n\n\nNote that # needs to be escaped with another # - hence the ## in the url above.\ntop\n \nThe  element specifies the location of your code base in a Perforce repository.\nNotes:\nGo will use directory under pipelines/{pipelineName} in agent side as Perforce root directory of perforce client workspace.\nAttributes\n\n\n\nAttribute\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nport\nYes\nPerforce server connection to use (host:port). This is the same as you would pass in the p4port parameter for the p4 command line or in the P4PORT environment variable.\n\n\nusername\nNo\nPerforce username to use.\n\n\npassword\nNo\nPassword for the specified user.\n\n\nuseTickets\nNo\nSet to true to work with perforce tickets. Go will do a p4 login using the supplied password before each command. We recommend that you make your user a part of a p4 group, and set the ticket timeout to unlimited as described here.\n\n\ndest\nOnly for multiple materials\nThe directory where the code will be checked out. This is relative to the sandbox of the Go Agent. Go prevents the destination folder from being outside the agent's sandbox.\n\n\nview\nYes\nValid Perforce view. The view should be a sub-element of P4. Click here to see details about VIEW of Perforce.\n\n\nmaterialName\nRequired if this material is referenced in pipeline labeltemplate\nThe name to identify a material. Material name can contain the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, fullstop, underscore and hyphen. Spaces are not allowed. Material name is case insensitive. It needs to be unique within a pipeline. The max length is 255 characters.\n\n\nautoUpdate\nNo\nBy default Go polls the repository for changes automatically. If autoUpdate is set to false then Go will not poll the repository for changes. Instead it will check for changes only when you trigger a pipeline that contains this material. If the same material is specified more than once in the configuration file, all of them must have the same value for autoUpdate.\n\n\ninvertFilter\nNo\nInverts any filter elements, turning them into whitelists. Only files that match the filter will trigger a new build.\n\n\n\nNotes:\nYou do not need to specify the above attributes if you have already defined them as system variables. So if you have a P4PASSWD variable\ndefined then you can leave out the \"password\" tag defined above. If you already have them defined as system variables and also in Go\nconfiguration, Go will overwrite them before running p4.\nViews consist of multiple mappings. Each mapping has two parts:\n\nThe left-hand side specifies one or more files in the depot and has the form: //depotname/file_specification\nThe right-hand side specifies one or more files in the client workspace and has the form: //clientname/file_specification\n\nGo creates a p4 client to check out files into its sandbox with the 'clobber' option set. This means, during material update all writable-but-unopened files in the workspace would be overwritten on the agent. All other options use default values as defined by Perforce. Client name is generated automatically by Go. Hence, you can use anything as 'clientname' on the right-hand side in view mapping. The client name format is: cruise-[hostname]-[pipeline name]-[a random hash code], for example \"cruise-myhostname-mypipelinename-wOaJ9kjpfgOLQCncki19ikXt5Q\". THE GO_P4_CLIENT environment variable will have the client name used. This variable can be used in scripts to get the client name\nGo views are in the same format as that used by Perforce itself. In fact you should be able to copy a Perforce view from your existing Perforce\nsetup and paste it into the view section.\nFor example:\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n  \n  ...\n\n\ntop\n \nThe  element specifies the location of your code base in a GIT repository. Go only supports remote repositories.\nNotes:\ngit versions 1.7 and above are supported by Go.\nIf 'branch' is defined, Go will check out the specified branch. Otherwise, Go will check out the master branch.\nIf there are submodules in the repository, Go will check out them as well.\nmsysGit on Windows has a defect which causes an error when using Go. Please ensure to use a build which fixes this.\nWhile installing msysGit On Windows machines for Go server or agents, please choose Option iii, namely Run Git and included UNIX tools from\nwindows command prompt\nIf you are using git through SSH on windows, please ensure that the HOME user environment variable is set to the full path of the parent\ndirectory where the .ssh/ directory is located.\nAttributes\n\n\n\nAttribute\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nurl\nYes\nGIT URL for the repository.\n\n\nbranch\nNo\na branch name in the repository.\n\n\nshallowClone\nNo\nAdd a --depth=N option to git cloning command on Go agent. Shallow clone truncates history to latest revisions, thus helps accelerating clone operation for repositories with long history. Cloning depth is dynamically calculated to ensure revisions from GO_FROM_REVISION to GO_TO_REVISION are included in the cloned repository.\n\n\ndest\nOnly for multiple materials\nThe directory under the sandbox of Go Agent. Go will check out the source code into this directory.\n\n\nmaterialName\nRequired if this material is referenced in pipeline labeltemplate\nThe name to identify a material. Material name can contain the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, fullstop, underscore and hyphen. Spaces are not allowed. Material name is case insensitive. It needs to be unique within a pipeline. The max length is 255 characters.\n\n\nautoUpdate\nNo\nBy default Go polls the repository for changes automatically. If autoUpdate is set to false then Go will not poll the repository for changes. Instead it will check for changes only when you trigger a pipeline that contains this material. If the same material is specified more than once in the configuration file, all of them must have the same value for autoUpdate.\n\n\ninvertFilter\nNo\nInverts any filter elements, turning them into whitelists. Only files that match the filter will trigger a new build.\n\n\n\nExamples are:\n\n  \n    \n  \n  ...\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  ...\n\n\ntop\n \nThe  element specifies the location of your code base in a TFS Source repository.\nAttributes\n\n\n\nAttribute\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nURL\nYes\nURL for the Collection on the TFS Server.\n\n\nDomain\nNo\nDomain name for TFS authentication credentials.\n\n\nUsername\nYes\nUsername of the account to access the TFS collection.\n\n\nPassword\nYes\nPassword of the account to access the TFS collection.\n\n\nProject Path\nYes\nThe project path within the TFS collection.\n\n\ndest\nOnly for multiple materials\nThe directory where the code will be checked out. This is relative to the sandbox of the Go Agent. Go prevents the destination folder from being outside the agent's sandbox.\n\n\ninvertFilter\nNo\nInverts any filter elements, turning them into whitelists.

This is required if this material is referenced in pipeline labeltemplate\nThe name to identify a material. Material name can contain the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, fullstop, underscore and hyphen. Spaces are not allowed. Material name is case insensitive. It needs to be unique within a pipeline. The max length is 255 characters.\n\n\n\nNotes:\nThe downstream pipeline wouldn't be triggered if there was no passed stage in the upstream pipeline.\nExamples\nSuppose there are four pipelines, and they are commonLib1, commonLib2, Server and Client. For example, the stage 'distStage' in commonLib1\npipeline can trigger the other two pipelines, and the stage 'pkgstage' in commonLib2 pipeline can trigger Server pipeline. The configuration\nwould be:\n\n  \n    \n    \n  \n  ...\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  ...\n\n\ntop\n \nThe  element specifies a set of jobs. If any job in a given stage fails then the stage will fail. If a stage has an  configuration with manual type it can only be triggered manually (i.e. a user must click on the trigger button on the UI). If the previous stage has failed, you can still trigger the following stage manually.\nNotes:\nThere must be at least one job in stage.\nAttributes\n\n\n\nAttribute\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nname\nYes\nThe name is used to identify a stage in the pipeline, so it has to be unique (case insensitive) for that . The available characters in stage name are following: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, fullstop, underscore and hyphen. Spaces are not allowed.\n\n\nfetchMaterials\nNo (Default: true)\nPerform material updates or checkouts on the agent. Set this attribute to false to skip this operation.\n\n\ncleanWorkingDir\nNo (Default: false)\nRemove all files/directories in the working directory on the agent.

It is executed on an agent. A job can fetch artifacts from Go Server, execute tasks and publish artifacts back\nto Go Server.\nA job can also be associated with a set of  or an elastic profile through the elasticProfileId attribute.\nResources are used to match a Job to an Agent. ElasticProfileId is used to match a job to an Elastic Agent. An Agent can run a Job if it has all the resources or elasticProfileId that the Job specifies.\nA job cannot have both resources as well as elasticProfileId.\nIf a Job has no resources then it can be built by any Agent (But not by an elastic agent)\nAttributes\n\n\n\nAttribute\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nname\nYes\nThe name of the job. The name must be unique (ignoring case) within a . The name can contain: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, fullstop, underscore and hyphen only. Spaces are not allowed.\n\n\nrunOnAllAgents\nNo\nIf set to 'true' then the Job will run on all agents that can run the job.\n\n\nrunInstanceCount\nNo\nIf set to 'x' (integer) then 'x' instances of Job will be spawned during scheduling. Environment variables GO_JOB_RUN_INDEX (with values 1-x for every Job) and GO_JOB_RUN_COUNT (with value x for each Job) will be exposed to each task of Job.\n\n\ntimeout\nNo\nA job can be configured to time out if it does not generate any console output for a period of time. Use this attribute to define the timeout value in minutes. Define timeout as 0 if the job should never time out. If the attribute is not defined, the default  level timeout behaviour will apply.\n\n\nelasticProfileId\nNo\nA job can be configured to run on an elastic agent by specifying this attribute, which maps to the id of an existing .

For example: 'GO_DEPENDENCY_LABEL_FRAMEWORK_DEV' is the environment variable where the name of the upstream pipeline is 'framework' and the upstream stage is 'dev'. Hyphen ('-') is an illegal character in an environment variable. So if a pipeline name or stage name contains '-', it will be converted into an underscore. For example, ‘pipeline-foo’ with stage ‘stage-foo’ becomes: GO_DEPENDENCY_LABEL_PIPELINE_FOO_STAGE_FOO.\n\n\nGO_TO_REVISION_\nThe lastest revision in modifications that the build running against for each configured SCM material.\n\n\nGO_FROM_REVISION_\nThe earlist revision in modifications that the build running against for each configured SCM material.\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\ntop\n \nSpecifies an Ant build to run.

The src attribute should point towards a folder that contains the test output files. Go will use these to generate a test report if the artifact type is test. Test\ninformation is placed in the Failures and Test sub-tabs. Test results from multiple jobs are aggregated on the stage detail pages. This allows you to see the results of tests from both functional and unit tests even if they are run in different jobs.\nAttributes\n\n\n\nAttribute\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntype\nYes\nType can be either build or test.

You can export\nthe values of properties over time. This allows you to track properties against certain builds, for example to see whether build time is\nimproving or getting worse.\nExample:\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n\ntop\n \nDefine a Property based on the contents of an XML file.\nAttributes\n\n\n\nAttribute\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nname\nYes\nThe name of the property.

It allows you to move it out of GoCD so that you can modify, control and version it\nexternally. Such modifications will be seen by a periodic poller in the GoCD server and it will merge those pipeline\nconfigurations into the pipelines it finds in the main configuration XML file. You can see a quick preview video of this\nfeature here.\nIt is important to note that not all pipelines need to be external to the config (any existing config, in any existing\nGoCD server will be valid). It is also important to note that this feature includes the ability for GoCD to monitor and\nmerge external pipelines defined in multiple \"config repositories\". It is also possible for a pipeline defined in a\nconfig repository to be dependent on a pipeline defined in the main config XML of the GoCD server.\nThis ability is exposed as a plugin endpoint and so, anyone can write a plugin for a config repository, to store the configuration in any manner you choose.\nHere's an image which shows the relationship between the different pieces of a setup such as this:\n\nA quick note about \"Infrastructure as code\": Many people seem to associate only being able to check in configuration to\na repository as a part of \"Infrastructure as code\". However, the ability to configure the GoCD server through code has\nexisted in various forms. For instance, gomatic, using\nGoCD APIs, yagocd,\ngocd-cli, etc. This is another way of doing the same. In this case, it's possible to\nmake it more declarative, depending on the plugin and possibly give more control to others.\nCurrently available plugins for storing pipelines as code\nPipelines can currently be stored using JSON or YAML.\nStoring pipeline configuration in JSON\nThe setup needed to allow this is:\n\nAfter starting the server, open the config XML (\"Admin -> Config XML\") and add a config repository for the server to poll. This tag should be added just after the \"\" tag, at the top level, as a child of \"\":\n   \n     \n       \n     \n   \n\n You can fork the repository mentioned above to your own GitHub account or locally, so that you can make some changes\n to see what happens. Any file ending in \".gopipeline.json\" is picked up by the plugin. Documentation of what is\n possible in the JSON is here.\n\nGive it a minute or so for the polling to happen. Once that happens, you should see three new pipelines on your\ndashboard, as a part of the \"demo\" pipeline group. You can make some changes to the JSON (change a group, add a\nstage, etc), and upon the next poll, the server will see those changes and apply them to the pipeline\nconfig. Remember that, if you make any changes and make a mistake, you'll see an error at the bottom right corner (a\nred box).\n\nYou can even have multiple repositories. Just repeat the  tag and make sure that there are no duplicate pipelines.\n\n\nStoring pipeline configuration in YAML\nTomasz announced a Yaml plugin. The setup needed to allow this is:\n\nAfter starting the server, open the config XML (\"Admin -> Config XML\") and add a config repository for the server to poll.

Fan-in material resolution will ensure that a pipeline triggers only when all its upstream pipelines have triggered off the same version of an ancestor pipeline or material. This will be the case when you have multiple components building in separate pipelines which all have the same ancestor and you want downstream pipelines to all use the same version of the artifact from the ancestor pipeline.\nWhen you have non trivial pipeline dependency graphs, significant differences in pipeline execution times and automatic builds/deployments, you may typically run into the following issues\n\nWasted builds : Premature runs which do not have the right version of dependent components because one of the dependent pipelines was faster than the rest.\nInconsistent results : Your deployment that depends on multiple components may have incompatible versions of components because the build times of these components are different\nIncorrect feedback : Your deployment to Production should happen only when it has successfully passed the UAT, Staging and Pre-Prod environments but it was triggered prematurely as soon as UAT went green.\nRunning code with the wrong tests : Your commit to SCM contains both code and tests written for the code. Your pipelines are modeled such that your acceptance or test pipeline runs after the build pipeline. Acceptance has to run with the right tests for the code but instead it triggers as soon as the commit goes through with the previous available version for tests.\n\nGoCD helps solve all of the above problems.\nHow to use fan-in:\n\nIn cases where your SCM material is used throughout the process you will need to define the same URL for the material throughout. This will let GoCD know that it is a shared material and GoCD will enforce fan-in wherever applicable. For example: code, tests, environment configuration are in http://svn.company.com/code, http://svn.company.com/tests, and http://svn.company.com/config respectively. In this case ensure for pipelines that need these materials, the url is set to the same value. For example the pipelines Build, Acceptance and Deploy have the material url http://svn.company.com\nPipelines where fan-in dependency resolution is required will need to have trigger type set as auto\n\nExample use cases for fan-in resolution\nCreating a gate to production\nI want to push a build into a number of environments in parallel (Manual QA, UAT for business sign off and performance testing) so that all these activities happen at the same time. So we have a pipeline dependency model as shown below\n\nFor the next step, when deploying to production, we have a pipeline that depends on all 3 of the above pipeline so that a build that has succeeded in all 3 environments is automatically pushed to production. This is shown below.\n\nSequence of Events and Resolution\n\nA new build is generated.\nThe build is pushed to QA, UAT and performance pipelines.\nRegardless of the time taken in each of these pipelines, GoCD will ensure that production is triggered only after all three pipelines go green with the same version of build. Production will use the right version of your build artifacts.\n\nHow to configure:\n\nProduction should have trigger type as auto.\nQA, UAT and Performance should have Build as a material. Trigger type for these pipelines can be either manual or auto.\n\nPicking the right version of dependent components\nI have three component pipelines (C1, C2, C3) and a package pipeline that fetches their artifacts and creates a deploy package. Components C2 and C3 depend on pipeline C1 and have it as a material. The pipeline for C2 builds quickly but C3 takes a while. So we have a pipeline dependency model as shown below\n\nThe package pipeline should not trigger as soon as C2 is done. It should trigger only if both C2 and C3 go green. Additionally Package should use the same version of C1 that was used by C2 and C3.\nSequence of Events and Resolution\n\nC1 is triggered on a change.\nC2 and C3 are triggered after C1 is successful.\nC2 builds quickly but C3 is still in Progress.\nGo resolves that C3 and C2 depend on a common ancestor C1. Hence GoCD will wait for C3 to finish.\nIf C3 goes green, the Package pipeline will trigger. It will use the right versions of C1, C2 and C3.\n\nHow to configure:\n\nAdd C1 as a material for pipelines C2 and C3\nAdd C2 and C3 as materials for pipeline Package.\nPackage should have trigger type as auto\n\nTest source code with the right version of tests\nYou check-in code and tests as part of the same commit. The build pipeline compiles code and creates an artifact. The Acceptance pipeline fetches the build artifact and runs the tests that were written for the compiled code. Acceptance has to use the same tests committed with the code. So we have a pipeline dependency model as shown below\n\nSequence of Events and Resolution\n\nOn committing the changes, the Build pipeline will trigger with the latest revision.\nAlthough Acceptance also has the same material dependency, GoCD will not trigger it immediately.\nBuild pipeline executes successfully.\nAcceptance will now trigger with the same version of the SCM and fetch the right build artifact from the Build pipeline.\n\nHow to configure:\n\nAdd the same SCM material to pipelines Build and Acceptance i.e the same URL.\nPipelines Build and Acceptance have trigger type as auto.\n\nLimitations\n\nFan-in and blacklist : If the pipelines contributing to the fan-in have blacklist in their material definitions, the target pipeline does not adhere to fan-in behavior.\n\nFor example, refer to the scenario above. P1 and P2 are two pipelines which use the same mercurial (hg) repository, with two folders say \"p1\" and \"p2\". P1 is configured with \"p2\" folder in the blacklist. Likewise P2 is configured with \"p1\" folder in the blacklist.\nThe first run of P1 happens when a check-in happens in \"p1\" folder. The first run of P2 happens when there is a check-in to \"p2\".\nIn this scenario, P3, which is dependant on P1 and P2 does not trigger.\n\n\nNotes\n\nFan-in as a feature is enabled by default. In case you need pipelines to trigger with every version regardless of ancestor versions you can disable fan-in. To disable fan-in you will need to add a system property and restart the GoCD server. On linux add the following line to /etc/default/go-server\nexport GO_SERVER_SYSTEM_PROPERTIES='-Dresolve.fanin.revisions=N'\n\nOn windows, in the config folder of the GoCD server installation, edit the wrapper-server.conf file, and add an additional property with the value '-Dresolve.fanin.revisions=N'. For example:\nwrapper.java.additional.17='-Dresolve.fanin.revisions=N'\n\nGoCD will apply fan-in dependency resolution for pipelines that have auto trigger type only.\n\n\n"},"advanced_usage/properties.html":{"url":"advanced_usage/properties.html","title":"Properties","summary":"Properties provide a simple way of collecting metrics over time.

The working directory is usually /var/lib/go-{server,agent} on linux, and C:\\Program Files\\Go {Server,Agent} on windows.\nconfigure appenders and encoders in the relevant logback-include.xml file for your agent or server\n\nExample logstash setup\nFor e.g. to send logs to logstash (using logstash-logback-encoder) one would need to perform the following:\n\ndownload all logstash-logback-encoder jars and dependencies into libs dir:\nlogstash-logback-encoder-4.11.jar\njackson-databind-2.9.1.jar\njackson-annotations-2.9.1.jar\njackson-core-2.9.1.jar\n\n\n\nThen follow the instructions on the README to configure your logback-include.xml to setup relevant appenders and encoders:\n\n\n\n  \n  \n      127.0.0.1:4560\n      \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\nOverride Existing logback.xml\nIf you'd like to completely override the packaged logback.xml, create a CONFIG_DIR\\logback.xml file. If such a file is present, GoCD will use the loggers and file appender provided in the file for logging. You can read more about logback configuration in the logback configuration documentation\nThe following is a sample logback.xml users can use to override logging for GoCD root logger. The example uses a user defined directory for writing logs.\n\n\n\n  \n    logs/production_server/gocd-server.log\n    \n      \n        %date{ISO8601} %-5level [%thread] %logger{0}:%line - %msg%n\n      \n    \n\n    \n      logs/production_server/gocd-server.log.%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.%i.gz\n      10 MB\n      50\n      512 MB\n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nPlease note while overriding the logging for your GoCD server, redirect all logs to appropriate files in order to avoid any loss of logs.\n\nExample gelf setup\nAnother example setup using GELF (Graylog Extended Log Format) using logback-gelf:\nDownload logback-gelf-1.1.0.jar and place it in libs directory.\nOn typical linux server, that can be done with\nwget \"http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/de/siegmar/logback-gelf/1.1.0/logback-gelf-1.1.0.jar\" -O /var/lib/go-server/libs/logback-gelf-1.1.0.jar\nConfigure logback-include.xml with any of the gelf appenders as defined on project documentation:\nAn example logging over UDP could look like this:\n\n    \n        graylog.mycompany.com\n        12201\n        \n            false\n            true\n            true\n            false\n            false\n            false\n            \n                %m%nopex\n            \n            \n                %m\n            \n            application:go-server\n            environment:production\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n"},"advanced_usage/compare_pipelines.html":{"url":"advanced_usage/compare_pipelines.html","title":"Compare Builds","summary":"Compare any two builds of a pipeline and see changes","keywords":"","body":"Compare Builds\nGoCD allows you to compare any two builds of a pipeline and see exactly what changes happened between those two instances.

Rather than start from scratch with command name and arguments, you now have the option to look up a command from a repository of useful commands maintained by the Go team. The lookup provides a starting point, you may need to edit the arguments, specify a working directory etc. Once saved, the behaviour is the same as a manually entered custom command. Take a look at this video to learn more.\nUsing the command repository\nThis feature can be used anywhere you need to specify a custom command.\n\nAdd a new pipeline\n\n\nAdd a new stage to a pipeline\n\nAdd a new job to a stage\nAdd a new task to a job\nEdit a task\n\n\nCustom commands and agents\nGo does not check if the command that you have specified is available on the agents.\nInstall the relevant command on all the agents where you want it to run. If it is not available on the default path, add it to the path in /etc/default/go-agent or equivalent. This requires an agent restart.\nAlternatively, create a symbolic link to the path to the executable from /bin or equivalent folder. This doesn't require an agent restart\n\nArgs style commands\nThe older args style commands are not supported by this feature. Please convert them to the new syntax using the config xml editor ( Admin > Config XML ). For example:\n\n\nbecomes\n\n  a\n  b\n  c\n\n\nBundled Repository\nThe default set of commands come from https://github.com/gocd/go-command-repo. This repository is maintained by the Go team. The Go server installer bundles a clone of this Git repository under /db/command_repository/default. Every upgrade of Go Server will overwrite the contents of this directory with an up to date set of commands. Hence, please do not add your commands here. Instead, set up a private repository.\nPulling Updates\nGo team will continue to add (and sometimes update) commands to the repository on GitHub. If you want to make these commands available to your Go server without waiting for a new release or without upgrading your Go server, you could git pull them into /db/command_repository/default as desired.\nLinux/Unix\nHere is a simple cron tab entry that you could add to Go service account's cron tab to pull commands once a day.\n@daily cd /db/command_repository/default;git pull >>/var/go/cronrun 2>&1\n\nCaution: Don't pull as root/administrator. Use the Go service account.\n\nWindows\nOn Windows, you could set up a scheduled task to run this script on a schedule.\necho %date% %time% >>c:\\pull-log.txt 2>&1\ncd \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Go Server\\db\\command_repository\\default\"\ngit pull >>c:\\pull-log.txt 2>&1\nGo caches these commands with a refresh interval of 30 minutes so you may not see the results of a pull immediately in the lookup unless you hit the reload cache button under the command repository section on the server configuration admin page.\nVia API\nYou may make a POST request to the path /go/api/admin/command-repo-cache/reload in order to update the command repository with the latest.\n$ curl -u username:password -X POST -H 'Confirm: true' http://goserver.com:8153/go/api/admin/command-repo-cache/reload\n\nPrivate Repository\nIf you want to add your own commands for look up, you should set up your own Git/Mercurial/Subversion/Perforce/TFS repository that your command authors can commit/check-in into.\nMake a clone/working copy available under /db/command_repository/. Symbolic links are not supported. Then switch Go Server to this location. To do this, go to Command Repository Management section of Server Configuration in Admin tab and change the default value\n\nFrom the Go server's point of view, the command repository is just a directory under which it recursively looks for valid command.xml files. Note that directory names starting with a dot will be ignored.\n\nGo will not lookup from the bundled repository if you switch to your own repository. You could choose to manually seed your private command repository with Go's bundled set of commands if you want to have them in addition to your own commands.\n\nRecommended process\n\nCommand author pushes/checks-in command to corporate version control system\nCron job on Go-server pulls/updates local repository/working copy in due course\nGo Server caches the commands to improve response time. In case of changes in the command repository, new command gets into the cache in one of the following ways:\nThe default cache invalidation interval of 30 mins kicks in and the cache gets refreshed\nGo server admin clicks on the RELOAD CACHE button\nGo server admin uses the reload API through a cron job or otherwise to force a cache reload.\n\n\n\n\nThe commands in the command repository are not part of your Go Server config. They become part of your Go server config only after you (optionally edit and) save them.\n\nCommand syntax and lookup logic\n\nThe above screenshot resulted from the command below:\n\n\n  -o\n  saveToFile\n  -u\n  user:password\n  http://targeturl\n\n\nThis is an example of valid command syntax. The command attribute is mandatory. No other attributes are valid. Zero or more arg child elements can be specified. No other child elements are allowed. One command file may only contain one command.\n\nPlease refer the README for full command and documentation syntax.\n\nWhen you lookup a command, the following logic is used to sort the resulting suggestions:\n\nExact matches of name in command documentation (or filename if name missing)\nPartial starts-with matches of name in command documentation (or filename if name missing)\nExact matches of keywords in command documentation\n\nWithin each category, the sorting is alphabetical.\nContributing Commands\nWe welcome commands contributed by users. Simply,\n\nfork this GitHub repo\nClone it locally\nCommit and push your change\nSend us a pull request\n\nAccepted commands will be bundled into the next release.\n"},"advanced_usage/one_click_backup.html":{"url":"advanced_usage/one_click_backup.html","title":"Backup GoCD Server","summary":"Use GoCD's administration interface or API to backup and restore GoCD server","keywords":"","body":"Backup GoCD Server\nYou can use GoCD's administration interface to perform an One-Click Backup of Go.

We suggest you backup GoCD when the GoCD Server is idle. Users who are logged into the GoCD Dashboard will be redirected to a maintenance page during the backup. On backup completion they will be redirected to the page they were on.\nIf you are using PostgreSQL Addon please refer to our documentation here for back and restore process.\n\nWhat is backed up?\nThe backup will be performed into the {ARTIFACT_REPOSITORY_LOCATION}/serverBackups directory. {ARTIFACT_REPOSITORY_LOCATION} for your server can be found as mentioned here.\nThe backup directory will be named backup_{TIMESTAMP} where the {TIMESTAMP} is the time when the backup was initiated.\n\nDatabase – This is in a zip called db.zip .

This contains both the external and bundled plugins.\nAddons - These are found at {SERVER_INSTALLATION_DIR}/addons/. This contains installed addons.\n\nStrategy to backup Artifacts and Test Reporting Data\nArtifacts and the Test Reporting Data keep getting new files and directories added to them. So, it is a good idea to use rsync to copy the contents of these two into a backup location.\nFor Instance: Lets say you have a copy of all the files till 12-02-2012 in a location. On 20-02-2012, you can do something like:\nrsync -avzP {ARTIFACT_LOCATION} {BACKUP_LOCATION}\n\nThis makes sure that only the files and directories that got newly added will be synced to the {BACKUP_LOCATION} and not the entire contents.\nRestoring GoCD using backup\n\nPlease refer to the this page to see what the {SERVER_INSTALLATION_DIR} location is on different platforms.\n\nThe restoration process is not automated and needs to be done manually. Please refer to the previous sections about the contents of the backup.\nSteps to restore\n\nIn order to restore the GoCD server from a backup, the server must first be stopped. Make sure the process is completely dead before starting the restoration.\nChoose the backup directory that you want to restore from.\n\nYou cannot restore from a backup whose version is bigger than the version of the GoCD server being used.\nFor example: If the backup is from version 12.3 and the server installation is of version 12.2, the restoration might not work. You can check the version of the backup from the version.txt file.\n\n\nYou might want to keep a copy of all the files and directories that are involved in restoration. This will help in troubleshooting if there was a problem. Following this, make sure all the destination directories mentioned in the following steps are empty.\nFor example: Before restoring the Database, make sure the {SERVER_INSTALLATION_DIR}/db/h2db is backed up and the directory is emptied.\n\nDatabase – Unzip the db.zip found in the backup directory. Unzip will create a file called cruise.h2.db . Copy this file to the directory {SERVER_INSTALLATION_DIR}/db/h2db .\nConfiguration - Unzip the config-dir.zip into a temp directory. Copy all the files from this directory to {SERVER_INSTALLATION_DIR}/config directory on Windows and Mac or /etc/go on Linux.\nConfiguration History - Unzip the config-repo.zip into temp directory. Recursively copy all the contents from this directory to {SERVER_INSTALLATION_DIR}/db/config.git .\nMake sure the ownership of all the files that are restored are the same as the user running the Go server.\nFor example: Make sure you run a \"chown -R go:go {SERVER_INSTALLATION_DIR}/db/h2db\" after Database restoration.\nStart the GoCD server\n\n"},"advanced_usage/cron_backup.html":{"url":"advanced_usage/cron_backup.html","title":"Timer Based GoCD Server Backup","summary":"Perform a scheduled backup of the GoCD server","keywords":"","body":"Perform GoCD server backups on a schedule\nTo run a GoCD server backup at a given time, use a timer.

The repo is available at /db/config.git. Any changes to the config,\neither through file-system, API or GoCD configuration UI is saved as a new commit in this repo. This allows auditing of\nall changes made to the configuration.\nNOTE: This repo must not be altered externally as this will lead to errors in GoCD.\nGarbage collection\nWith time, this repository grows in size and can considerably slow down config save operations. One way to\ntackle this is to run git gc manually on the repo (read more). However, doing this\nat the wrong time (say, when the server is running and trying to finish a config save operation) can cause problems.\nSo, GoCD has in-built garbage collection for this git repository and it can be configured to run on a periodic\nbasis. However, since this activity can potentially take a long time to run when GC happens for the first time around,\nthe feature is turned off by default. GoCD server periodically checks if the loose-object count exceeds a preset\nthreshold and displays a warning message. This is a cue for users to enable periodic GC on their servers. Here are the\nsteps you need to follow (and in this order) to enable periodic GC for the config repository:\n\nStop the GoCD server\n\nTake a backup of the whole config.git directory (rememeber, there is a hidden .git directory in it)\n\nRun git gc manually, once, in that directory as the user that the GoCD server runs under. On Unix/Linux, this is\nusually the \"go\" user. Do not run this as the root user. If you do, make sure that you run chown -R go:go\n/path/to/config.git to make sure that the ownership of that directory is proper.\n\nOnce you've done that, you can now set these system properties mentioned below, to change the behavior of the\nperiodic garbage collection. At the very least, you should set the go.config.repo.gc.periodic system property to\nY so that it is enabled. You can refer to the documentation to find out how to set these arguments for your\nWindows and\nLinux servers.\n\nStart the server and verify that the properties you've set are reflected in the system. The section at the end of\nthis page has details about it.\n\n\nSystem properties that affect periodic garbage collection\nProperty: go.config.repo.gc.periodic\n\nDefault value: N\n\nThis enables the periodic garbage collection of config.git repo. To enable this feature - set the value to Y\nProperty: go.config.repo.gc.aggressive\n\nDefault value: Y\n\nThis option will cause GC to more aggressively optimize the repository at the expense of taking much more time. It can\nbe made non-aggressive by setting this value to N. It is recommended to set this option to N if the system property \ngo.config.repo.gc.cron is set up to run git gc frequently. \nProperty: go.config.repo.gc.cron\n\nDefault value: 0 0 7 ? * SUN\n\nCron expression to specify garbage collector execution time with default set to 7:00 am on sundays.

It needs to listen on a specific host. This host determines which\nclients (users as well as GoCD Agents) can access the GoCD Server. By default, the\nserver listens on 0.0.0.0, which is the wildcard or \"unspecified\" address.\nUsually, this means that the GoCD Server can be accessed through any network\ninterface. In some, more advanced networking setups, it might be needed to\noverride this, typically to 127.0.0.1, so that only clients local to the box can\naccess it.\nAnother way to set this, on Linux installations, is to set the environment\nvariable SERVER_LISTEN_HOST, which is used by the\nserver startup shell script, to set the cruise.listen.host system property.\n\ncruise.server.port - HTTP port for the Go Server\n\nName: cruise.server.port\nType: System property\nRestrictions: Should be the number of a valid port that is not used by another\nprocess\n\nSimilar to the cruise.listen.host property, the value of\nthis property determines which port the Go Server binds to, and accepts HTTP\nconnections from.

Each plugin is assigned an identifier which is determined by the id attribute provided in plugin metadata file packaged along with the plugin jar. If the metadata file is not packaged, plugin jar file name will be taken as plugin id. Plugins are classified into two categories - Bundled and External. During startup, GoCD server would try to load all the plugins. On successful load, the plugin will be converted into an OSGi bundle and extracted into /plugins_work directory. Plugins tab, under GoCD server Administration, would list all the loaded plugins.\nBundled versus External\n\nBundled Plugins: As the name suggests, bundled plugins are bundled/packaged along with GoCD server. These are developed and supported by Thoughtworks GoCD development team. Bundled plugins are located under /plugins/bundled directory. After an upgrade, when GoCD server starts up for the first time, all bundled plugins would be refreshed with the latest packaged versions.\n\nExternal Plugins: All user authored plugins are treated as external plugins. Unlike bundled plugins, external plugins are not altered (read packaged/bundled/refreshed/removed/modified) during a GoCD server upgrade. External plugins are loaded from /plugins/external directory. Listing of external plugins\n\n\nInstalling and Uninstalling of plugins\nYou need access to the GoCD server machine to be able to install/uninstall a plugin. To install a plugin, drop the plugin jar under the external plugin directory ( /plugins/external ) and restart GoCD server. To uninstall a plugin, remove the plugin jar from the external plugin directory ( /plugins/external ) and restart GoCD server.\nYou may also use this beta feature to quick load plugins without restarting GoCD server.\nPlugins Tab\nPlugins tab can be found under GoCD server Administration. Plugins tab shows all the plugins that have been loaded currently along with its details and status. If a plugin is marked invalid or incompatible, the reasons for the same would be reported here.\n\nNotes\n\nAdd/delete/upgrade of a plugin will take effect only after a GoCD server restart.\nTwo plugins cannot have same id irrespective of whether it is a bundled or an external plugin.\nIf two external plugins with same id are available, only one of them will be loaded successfully in no specific order.\nIf a bundled and an external plugin with same id are available, only bundled plugin wll be loaded.\n\n"},"extension_points/package_repository_extension.html":{"url":"extension_points/package_repository_extension.html","title":"Package Repository Extension","summary":"Pipelines in GoCD can poll packages in repositories similar to how they poll version control systems.","keywords":"","body":"GoCD Package Material\nIntroduction\nPoll from GoCD packages and more from GoCD 13.3 onwards\nPipelines in GoCD can poll packages in repositories similar to how they poll version control systems. A build typically consumes source code maintained in a version control system (VCS/SCM). What about a typical deployment? Increasingly, the input for deployments is the build result packaged as:\n\njar, war or ear file in case of Java\nnuget/ chocolatey package in case of .NET\nLinux system package (e.g rpm, deb) in case of any application platform\nOther application level package formats like gem, npm, phar, wheel etc.\n\nThese files (packages) are often maintained in corresponding package repositories. Such packages may be specified as materials for GoCD pipelines.\nSupported Packages\nSince there are many package formats each with its own package manager and repository, the support for package-as-material has been implemented as an extension point. Using the bundled yum-repo-poller plugin, it is possible to specify an rpm package held in a yum repository as a material for a GoCD pipeline. Using other external plugins, it is possible to do the same for other types of packages.\nRepositories, Packages and Materials\nA repository may contain one or more packages. A pipeline may refer to a package as a material. When the package is updated in the repository, interested pipelines will get scheduled.\nRepository Definition\nA package material plugin lets pipeline group admins provide details of the corresponding repository type to GoCD. e.g. here is how we define a yum repository using the bundled yum-repo-poller plugin.\nNote:\n\nThe repository name is not used by the package material plugin - it is used by Go to construct the material name.\nTwo package repositories cannot have the same name.\nUse the check connection button to ensure that Go can work with this repository.\n\n\nPackage Definition\nA package material plugin also lets you define packages at the time of pipeline material configuration (Admin > Material >Add Material > Package). Here is what it looks like for defining RPM packages with the bundled yum plugin. The package name is not used by the package material plugin - it is used by Go to construct the material name. Two packages in a repository cannot have the same name. Use the check package button to ensure that the package definition does indeed resolve to the package you are looking for.\n\nUnlike other VCS/SCM materials, the material definition in case of packages is not contained within the pipeline definition. Many pipelines may have material definitions referring to the same package. Here is how we associate an existing package as material for a pipeline.\n\nNote:\nEach package definition must resolve to exactly one package on the repository, else the pipeline will not run. In order to set up a pipeline that polls for multiple packages, configure each package as a separate material.\nEach package material plugin defines a subset of its properties as a package fingerprint. e.g. in case of the bundled yum plugin this subset consists of Repository URL and Package Spec (it excludes repository username and password). Repository and Package names are not part of package fingerprint. It is not permitted to multiple packages having the same package fingerprint. An attempt to do so will result in an error message like this:\nThe following error(s) need to be resolved in order to perform this action:\nCannot save package or repo, found duplicate packages. [Repo Name: 'orchard', Package Name: 'apple'], [Repo Name: 'orchard', Package Name: 'orange']\nSample XML Configuration\nHere is a XML view of an RPM package definition. Note the relation between repository, package and pipeline material. Loosely typed property, key and value tags are used for repository and package configuration in order to accommodate different plugins. If you choose to configure via direct XML edit, note that it isn't necessary to provide repository and package IDs, Go server will autogenerate them. However, not all validations that are performed while configuring via UI kick in while configuring via XML edit - the resulting failures will show up later in the server health message panel at the bottom right of the browser frame.\n\n  \n  \n    \n      REPO_URL\n      http://public-yum.oracle.com/repo/OracleLinux/OL6/latest/x86_64\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          PACKAGE_SPEC\n          gcc-4.*\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n  ...\n\nValue stream modeling tip\nDepending on whether GoCD is also publishing the package or just consuming it, there are two options for modeling a value stream that includes packages.\n\nThe first scenario is where the package is published from some pipeline in GoCD. Say pipeline X publishes package P to an external repo and pipeline Y consumes P. To trigger Y after publication of P, there are two options:\n\nPipeline dependency: X becomes a material for Y. Y resolves the exact version of P and downloads it on its own (although this tip may be used to pass package version information from X to Y). X will appear as an upstream component of Y in the value stream map.\nPackage material: Y adds P as a package material. Y no longer has to resolve P.\n\nIt isn't advisable to do both as Y will then schedule twice. The choice depends on how closely the activities in pipeline X and Y are related. If it is important to see X and Y together in the same value stream map, then option #1 makes sense.\n\nThe second scenario is where GoCD does not know about how/who published the package. Perhaps it got published by a job in Jenkins. Or perhaps the package is an open source package on a public repository on the internet. In this case the only option is to use a package material. GoCD helps you trace back to the external origin of the package if the package creator adds trackback information to the package metadata. The details of this will vary by plugin. In case of the bundled yum plugin, we use the URL field in rpm metadata for this.\n\nPermissions\nRepositories and their packages are global entities not tied to a pipeline group or environment. Pipeline group admins may define repositories and packages for use in their pipelines. One pipeline group admin may also use packages defined by another for their pipelines. Changing a package definition will cause all dependent pipelines to schedule - even those not in the same pipeline group as that of the person editing. Because of this, we don't have a UI way of changing the definition of a package. Only the GoCD admin can change it via Admin > Config XML tab.\nPolling\nEven if no pipelines use a package, GoCD polls for newer packages every minute. This may be turned off at a package level by setting autoUpdate to false via the config xml (GoCD admins only). autoUpdate is turned on by default. When a newer package is found, the pipelines for which it is a material get scheduled (assuming auto scheduling of pipelines is on). Also see API scheduling.\nPackage information display\nThe following information is expected from the package material plugin (which in turn obtains it from the package metadata if available)\n\nPackage revision (e.g. gcc-4.4.7-3.el6.x86_64)\nPackage build time\nName of package creator (if available)\nPackage comment\nTrackback URL - Typically an absolute URL that indicates what job (in GoCD or otherwise) created the package.\nPackage - material name (i.e. repo-name:package-name)\n\nAt the time of building the package, it is recommended to include as much of the above information as possible so that it is available for Go to display as below.\n\nDownloading the package\nThe package isn't automatically downloaded on the agent and made available to the jobs. This is unlike VCS/SCM materials where a checkout is made by default. In case of packages, the GoCD Agent is typically not the target node for deployment, it is only orchestrating deployment to a remote node. So, instead of an automatic download, the following environment variables are made available:\n\nGO_PACKAGE___LABEL\nGO_REPO___REPO_URL\nGO_PACKAGE___LOCATION\n\nRepository and package names are converted to all uppercase and hyphens are converted to underscores before inclusion in the environment variable names. For example, let's say we set up a repository named ORA pointing to http://public-yum.oracle.com/repo/OracleLinux/OL6/latest/x86_64 and define a package gcc with a spec of gcc-4.* and set it up as material for a pipeline. To download the package locally on the agent, we could write a task like this:\n[go] Start to execute task: \n-c\ncurl -o /tmp/gcc.rpm $GO_PACKAGE_ORA_GCC_LOCATION\n\nWhen the task executes on the agent, the environment variables get subsituted as below:\n[go] Start to execute task: \n-c\ncurl -o /tmp/gcc.rpm $GO_PACKAGE_ORA_GCC_LOCATION\n.\n...\n[go] setting environment variable 'GO_PACKAGE_ORA_GCC_LABEL' to value 'gcc-4.4.7-3.el6.x86_64'\n[go] setting environment variable 'GO_REPO_ORA_GCC_REPO_URL' to value 'http://public-yum.oracle.com/repo/OracleLinux/OL6/latest/x86_64'\n[go] setting environment variable 'GO_PACKAGE_ORA_GCC_PACKAGE_SPEC' to value 'gcc-4.*'\n[go] setting environment variable 'GO_PACKAGE_ORA_GCC_LOCATION' to value 'http://public-yum.oracle.com/repo/OracleLinux/OL6/latest/x86_64/getPackage/gcc-4.4.7-3.el6.x86_64.rpm'\n...\nOr, to simply pass it as an argument to a deploy script on a remote server\n\n    -c\n    ssh server \"cd /to/dest/dir;deploy.sh $GO_PACKAGE_ORA_GCC_LOCATION\"\n\n\nAlso see Installing RPMs\n\nImportant: Please note that if you change repository credentials and then try to re-trigger (redeploy) an old package, the published environment variables will not reflect new credentials.\n\nPublishing a Package\nAt the moment, GoCD does not create or publish the package for you. But it is simple enough for each type of package. e.g. rpm\nYou could also explore the command repository on GitHub for helpful commands. What is command repository? Please see this.\nPackage Dependencies\nPlease note that GoCD does not support any sort of automatic polling or other support for package dependencies. Each package dependency has to specified as a separate material if needed. Alternatively, just poll for the packages at the root of the dependency graph and let the package manager figure out the rest at the time of installation. e.g. if componentA-1.2.0-b234-noarch.rpm depends on componentB-2.3.0 or above, simply poll for componentA and let\nyum install componentA-1.2.0-b234-noarch\n\ndo the resolution of componentB for you.\n"},"extension_points/yum_repository_poller.html":{"url":"extension_points/yum_repository_poller.html","title":"Yum Repository Poller","summary":"Yum repository poller is available for GoCD servers running on Linux nodes.","keywords":"","body":"Yum Repository Poller\nNote: This plugin is available for GoCD servers running on Linux nodes having repoquery installed (part of the yum-utils package, Ubuntu, CentOS)\nIntroduction\nThe Yum repository poller is a bundled package material plugin capable of polling yum repositories for rpm packages. GoCD server interacts with this plugin via package material plugin interfaces. The plugin makes use of a command similar to the following to poll the server. So it does not depend on the files that yum depends on e.g. files under /etc/yum.repos.d\nrepoquery --repofrompath=uuid,$REPO_URL --repoid=uuid -q $PACKAGE_SPEC -qf \"%{LOCATION}...\"\n\nA given instance of polling is considered successful if repoquery returns a single package as output.\n\nRepository definition\nRepo URL must be a valid http, https or file URL. This plugin looks for the presence of $REPO_URL/repodata/repomd.xml to ascertain validity. Basic authentication (user:password@domain/path) is supported for http and https repositories.\nPackage definition\nIn case of this plugin, the package definition is completely determined by the package spec. The package spec may be in any of the following formats. Please refer the repoquery man page for details.\nname\nname.arch\nname-ver\nname-ver-rel\nname-ver-rel.arch\nname-epoch:ver-rel.arch\nepoch:name-ver-rel.arch\nShell glob patterns may also be used. For example, say we have a component under development getting ready for release of version 1.2.0. We cut a branch for the release and bump up the version on trunk/master to 1.3.0. Thus, a package generated by trunk/master may look like mycomp-1.3.0-b72349-noarch.rpm while that generated by branch may look like mycomp-1.2.0-b72344-noarch.rpm. Now if we have a deployment pipeline that is only interested in 1.2 series packages, the package spec needs to be mycomp-1.2.* rather than just mycomp.\nPackage Metadata\nThe following rpm metadata is accessed by the plugin\n\nBuildTime (required, automatically set by rpmbuild) - Used by the plugin to validate if the package is newer than what was last seen by GoCD. GoCD displays this field as Modified On.\nPackager - GoCD displays this field as Modified By. If not provided, it is shown as anonymous\nURL - Displayed as a Trackback URL by GoCD.

If multiple versions of a package get published to a repo in the time interval between two polls, GoCD will only register the latest version in that interval.\nThis plugin makes use of buildtime in rpm metadata to determine if a poll has returned a new result. If for some reason (e.g. timezone misconfiguration), the buildtime of pkg-1.1 is less than that of pkg-1.0, then the plugin will not register pkg-1.1 as a newer package.\nThe only way to update an rpm is to change the version or release.

Assuming you have the plugin installed, you'll see that the dropdown in the job configuration UI has changed to look like this:\n\nWhen selected, the dialog box which allows you to configure details about the task looks like this:\n\nIn the configuration XML, the information entered for this task looks like this:\n\n  \n  \n    \n      Url\n      http://www.google.com\n    \n    \n      SecureConnection\n      no\n    \n    \n      RequestType\n      -G\n    \n    \n      AdditionalOptions\n      \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nWhen a build which uses the plugin runs, the output of the build looks something like this:\n[go] Start to execute task: Plugin with ID: curl.task.plugin.\nLaunching command: [curl, -G, --insecure, -o, pipelines/up42/index.txt, http://www.google.com]\nEnvironment variables:\nName= MAVEN_OPTS  Value= -Xms256m -Xmx512m\nName= GO_STAGE_COUNTER  Value= 1\nName= GO_REVISION_BLAH  Value= cde1e03a05170b991a92a136278c3464e4f35fe7\nName= GO_JOB_NAME  Value= up42_job\nName= EDITOR  Value= vim\nName= SECURITYSESSIONID  Value= 186a4\n... lots more environment variables ...\n% Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\nDload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n\n0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0\n0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:--  0:00:02 --:--:--     0\n100   259  100   259    0     0    122      0  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--   122\nYou can write a task plugin in GoCD using JSON API - Message based\n"},"extension_points/notification_extension.html":{"url":"extension_points/notification_extension.html","title":"Notification Extension","keywords":"","body":"\n\nRedirecting...\n\n  This page has moved to \n  https://plugin-api.gocd.org/current/notifications.\n\n\n  Click here if you are not redirected.\n\nwindow.location.href=\"https://plugin-api.gocd.org/current/notifications\";\n"},"extension_points/configrepo_extension.html":{"url":"extension_points/configrepo_extension.html","title":"Configuration repository Extension","summary":"Move pipeline configurations out of GoCD and its cruise-config.xml file so that you can modify them externally.","keywords":"","body":"Configuration repository Extension\nGoCD supports writing configuration plugins starting 16.7.\nIt is a feature which allows you to move pipeline configurations out of GoCD and its cruise-config.xml file into one or more source-control repositories (e.g. git), so that you can modify them externally. Such modifications will be seen by a periodic poller in the GoCD server and it will merge those pipeline configurations into the pipelines it finds in the main configuration XML file.\nConfiguration plugins allow users to keep both pipeline and environment configurations\nin all version control systems supported by GoCD.\nMost elements of pipelines and environments available in XML are supported by configuration repositories.\nHowever there are a few exceptions, you cannot use in configuration repositories:\n\nGoCD pipeline templates, nor references to templates. Note that you can write a plugin that supports pipeline templates in any way you want\nparameters\n\nThe format in which configurations are stored is fully controlled by the plugin,\nso pipelines and environments can be stored for example in JSON, YAML, XML, dot files or any convention that can store necessary information.\nThere are certain limits involved when using configuration repository:\n\nIt is not possible to edit remote pipeline or environment using UI\nElements defined via UI cannot refer to external ones. The other way around is possible.\nPipeline templates and parameters are not supported\n\nMerging configurations\nGoCD server polls all materials from pipelines and user-defined configuration repositories.\nThe final server configuration is merged from cruise-config.xml and remote elements in repositories.\nIt is important to pay attention to errors introduced in repositories.\nIt is highly recommended to remove any errors as soon as GoCD reports them. For configuration repositories the only way to so is by pushing changes to faulty repository.\nAll configuration errors are displayed in server health messages.\nMore details about handling configuration repository errors in GoCD server are lower.\nMerging pipeline groups\nPipeline's membership in a group can be defined in many configuration repositories and cruise-config.xml.\nE.g. group project1 can be spread across many configuration repositories,\n then finally in Go server all these pipelines will show up in one group project1.\nMerging environments\nSimilarly to pipeline groups, final members of environments are a sum of elements in\nall configuration repositories. E.g.\n\nin repository A we can define that pipeline1 is member of environment development\nin repository B we can define that pipeline2 and pipeline3 is member of environment development\nin repository C we can define that pipeline3 is member of environment development\n\nThen in GoCD server, the final pipelines in environment development are pipeline1, pipeline2, pipeline3.\nNotice that pipeline3 membership in environment development was declared twice.\nSame approach is used for agents.\nEnvironment variables have an additional check. If you assign same environment variable\nwith 2 different values then it is considered configuration merge conflict.\nErrors in configuration repository\nThere are several ways in which current configuration can be invalid because of errors in configuration repository.\nConfiguration repository plugin Error\nThe least problematic situation is when plugin or extension point has detected problems with remote configuration part alone.\nThen Go does not attempt to merge this configuration repository and previous configuration part stays active. You should fix errors reported by GoCD server health messages in order to see any new changes from that configuration repository.\nIf you don't fix such error, there are no other consequences than having old configuration.\nMany errors of this type can exist simultaneously - there can be many invalid repositories in this way.\nInvalid Merged Configuration Error\nIn some situations it is not possible to create merged configuration from configuration repositories\nand main GoCD configuration. Then server health messages reports Invalid Merged Configuration.\nThe common cases that will cause this error are:\n\na pipeline is configured both through UI (in cruise-config.xml) and in on of configuration repositories.\npipelines with same name are declared in many configuration repositories.\none of the pipelines refers to non-existing pipeline. Or more generally some configuration element refers to other that does not exist.\nplugin or extension point is not doing enough validations on the remote configuration part alone. This causes server to assemble merged configuration from part which is invalid.\n\nThere are limitations in how Go server can handle this type of error(s):\n\nGoCD can handle situation when there are errors in exactly one of the repositories. You will not see new configuration changes from invalid repository until error is fixed. Other configuration repositories and edits to Config XML will be operational. You should fix Invalid Merged Configuration anyway to avoid being in next situation...\nWhen 2 or more configuration repositories are invalid - you may start experiencing being locked out from editing configuration through UI. Changes to XML will be rejected. Reasons for this are beyond scope of this document. You must fix all configuration repositories first.\n\nReferences\n\nIntroduction to configuration repositories\nGithub issue including very long debate on how Go should behave\nExample configuration repository in JSON\nExample configuration repository in YAML\n\n"},"gocd_on_kubernetes/":{"url":"gocd_on_kubernetes/","title":"GoCD on Kubernetes","keywords":"","body":"\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n       Getting Started with GoCD on Kubernetes\n    \n    \n"},"gocd_on_kubernetes/introduction.html":{"url":"gocd_on_kubernetes/introduction.html","title":"Introduction","summary":"The GoCD Helm Chart page explains how to get started with GoCD for kubernetes using Helm.","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nGoCD gives you the flexibility to effectively represent CD pipelines that suit your organization’s processes.

Setup a Kubernetes Cluster\nBefore installing GoCD, you need to setup a Kubernetes cluster. You can do this using any of the following tools:\n\nOption 1: Minikube (setup guide)\nOnce minikube is installed, start minikube with the kubeadm bootstrapper. The kubeadm toolkit helps to easily bootstrap a cluster so that appropriate privileges are granted for performing read-write operations on Kubernetes authentication and authorization (RBAC) resources.\nminikube start --vm-driver=virtualbox --bootstrapper=kubeadm --memory 4096\n\n\nOption 2: Google Kubernetes Engine or GKE (setup guide)\nTip: Once the cluster is running, execute the following command to see if kubectl is using right context.\n  $ kubectl config current-context\n  gke_my-project_us-central1-a_gocd-cluster\n\n\nOption 3: Kubernetes Operations on AWS/GCE or kops (setup guide)\nOther References\n\nManage Kubernetes Clusters on AWS Using Kops\nInstalling Kubernetes on AWS with kops\n\n\n\n3.

This section identifies the approaches and the drawbacks to keep in mind when using these approaches. \nDocker in Docker (DinD)\nDocker in Docker involves setting up a docker binary and running an isolated docker daemon inside the container. This requires that the host docker container be run in privileged mode. The privileged flag enables the host container to do almost all of the things that the underlying host machine can do. We have provided the GoCD Agent DinD image that can be used to run docker related tasks in a GoCD agent.\nDrawbacks:\nAs explained by jpetazzo in his blogpost, there are some cases where DinD may not work for you. Additionally, there is a security risk of running a container in privileged mode as well.\nDocker Out of Docker (DooD)\nDocker out of Docker involves volume mounting the host's docker socket onto the GoCD agent container and use the host's docker daemon to execute the docker related commands from the CI.\nThis can be achieved by doing:\n$ docker run -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -e GO_SERVER_URL=\"https://:8154/go\" gocd/gocd-agent-alpine-3.7:v18.1.0\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nName conflicts may occur if there are two containers with the same name that the GoCD agents bring up.\nConsider the cleanup of the containers after a build completes. The GoCD agent container is brought up and down by an elastic agent plugin. However containers brought up by these ephemeral GoCD agents for build and test are not automatically terminated up by the plugin at the end of a build. They must be explicitly cleaned up before the GoCD agent is brought down. In addition, layers of images are cached and reused. Build isolation is lost.\nThe containers brought up this way are outside of the helm scope and not easily accessible.\n\nUsing a single docker GoCD agent image\nIn cases where DinD and DooD both don’t work for your use case, an alternative is to package all the build time dependencies into a single docker image. Use this docker image with the GoCD Elastic Agents to run the builds. This works only if you are not choosing to containerize your application builds and tests. In other words, this works well for a workflow that doesn't involve running docker related commands using elastic agents.\n"},"gocd_on_kubernetes/gocd_helm_chart/configure_k8s_ea_plugin.html":{"url":"gocd_on_kubernetes/gocd_helm_chart/configure_k8s_ea_plugin.html","title":"Configure the Kubernetes Elastic Agent plugin","keywords":"","body":"Kubernetes elastic agent plugin\n\nGoCD agents are “workers” and execute tasks that make up jobs, stages and the pipeline.

Depending\non the kind of process used in the task, environment variables are accessed differently. Presented below are some common\nusage scenarios, with the assumption that a job has been configured with an environment variable called ENV_VAR_1,\nwith the value VALUE_1.\n1. Using an environment variable in a custom command on Unix/Linux\nA very common use case for environment variables is to use them as arguments for a custom command\n(\"exec task\" in GoCD). Assuming\nthat you want to pass the environment variable ENV_VAR_1 to the ls command, you might be tempted to try something\nlike this:\n\n  \n  Figure 1: Wrong usage of environment variable in custom command task (Will not work)\n\n\nWhen run, it will end with a message like this:\n\n  \n  Figure 2: Result of wrong usage of environment variable in custom command task\n\n\nAs you can see, the environment variable, $ENV_VAR_1 was passed in literally to the command ls and was not\ninterpolated. What is happening here is that GoCD is directly executing the command and passing in the parameters,\nwithout involving a shell like bash or sh in the middle. When a command such as ls $ENV_VAR_1 is executed from the\ncommand-line, the shell process is the one that interpolates the environment variable and replaces it with its value, so\nthat the ls command does not see it.\nSo, we need to do the same here. The correct way to invoke this, so that the interpolation of the environment variable\nworks is like this:\n\n  \n  Figure 3: Correct usage of environment variable in custom command task\n\n\nWhen run, it will end with a message like this:\n\n  \n  Figure 4: Result of correct usage of environment variable in custom command task\n\n\nEven though the command failed in this example, the value of the environment variable was interpolated. You can replace\nls with some other command, but the concept remains the same.\n2. Using an environment variable in a custom command on Windows\nThis is easier than using it in a shell script because, on Windows GoCD agents, commands are executed by wrapping them\nin cmd /c. So, environment variables get interpolated automatically. So, with a configuration such as this:\n\n  \n  Figure 5: Usage of environment variable on Windows\n\n\nWhen run, it will end with a message like this:\n\n  \n  Figure 8: Result of usage of environment variable on Windows\n\n\nSimilarly, it works when used in a batch file (say, \"env_var.cmd\"), with content such as this:\necho Environment variable ENV_VAR_1 is: %ENV_VAR_1%\nNotice that, unlike on Unix/Linux, the way to access an environment variable on Windows is to use %, instead of $.\n3. Using an environment variable in a shell-script - On Unix/Linux\nUsing an environment variable inside a shell-script is not special at all. You can directly use it, as you would any\nenvironment variable. For instance, a shell-script with this content, will work when executed normally:\n#!/bin/sh\n\necho \"Value of environment variable ENV_VAR_1 is: $ENV_VAR_1\"\nThis works when executed directly, with a config such as this:\n\n  \n  Figure 9: Usage of environment variable in a shell-script\n\n\nWhen run, it will end with a message like this:\n\n  \n  Figure 10: Result of usage of environment variable in a shell-script\n\n\n\n4. Using an environment variable in a ruby script\nAgain, using an environment variable inside a ruby script is not special at all. This has been mentioned here, just to\nshow that scripts written in different languages have to use different mechanisms to access environment variables. A\nruby script such as this works as expected:\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby\n\nputs \"Environment variable ENV_VAR_1 has the value: #{ENV['ENV_VAR_1']}\"\nStandard GoCD environment variables\nThe examples above mention a custom environment variable set at the job level. However, there are some standard\nenvironment variables available during every job run, set by GoCD.

This is only set if the environment is specified. Otherwise the variable is not set.\nDevelopment\n\n\nGO_PIPELINE_NAME\nName of the current pipeline being run\nmain\n\n\nGO_PIPELINE_COUNTER\nHow many times the current pipeline has been run.\n2345\n\n\nGO_PIPELINE_LABEL\nLabel for the current pipeline. By default, this is set to the pipeline count (this can be set to a custom pipeline label)\n1.1.2345\n\n\nGO_STAGE_NAME\nName of the current stage being run\ndev\n\n\nGO_STAGE_COUNTER\nHow many times the current stage has been run\n1\n\n\nGO_JOB_NAME\nName of the current job being run\nlinux-firefox\n\n\nGO_TRIGGER_USER\nUsername of the user that triggered the build. This will have one of three possible valuesanonymous - if there is no securityusername of the user, who triggered the buildchanges, if SCM changes auto-triggered the buildtimer, if the pipeline is triggered at a scheduled time\nchanges\n\n\nGO_DEPENDENCY_LABEL_${pipeline name}\nThe label of the upstream pipeline (when using dependent pipelines)\n1.0.3456\n\n\nGO_DEPENDENCY_LOCATOR_${pipeline name}\nThe locator of the upstream pipeline (when using dependent pipelines), which can be used to create the URL for RESTful API calls\nupstream/1.0.3456/dev/1\n\n\nGO_REVISION\nThe current source control revision being run (when using only one material)\n123\n\n\nGO_REVISION_${material name or dest}\nIf you are using more than one material in your pipeline, the revision for each material is available. The environment variable is named with the material's \"materialName\" attribute. If \"materialName\" is not defined, then \"dest\" directory is used. Non alphanumeric characters are replaced with underscores (\"_\").\n123\n\n\nGO_TO_REVISION\nIf the pipeline was triggered with a series of source control revisions(say 121 to 123), then this environment variable has the value of the latest revision (when using only one material). This is always same as GO_REVISION.\n123\n\n\nGO_TO_REVISION_${material name or dest}\nIf you are using more than one material in your pipeline, the 'to' revision for each material is available. The environment variable is named with the material's \"materialName\" attribute. If \"materialName\" is not defined, then \"dest\" directory is used. Non alphanumeric characters are replaced with underscores (\"_\").\n123\n\n\nGO_FROM_REVISION\nIf the pipeline was triggered with a series of source control revisions(say 121 to 123), then this environment variable has the value of the oldest revision (when using only one material)\n121\n\n\nGO_FROM_REVISION_${material name or dest}\nIf you are using more than one material in your pipeline, the 'from' revision for each material is available. The environment variable is named with the material's \"materialName\" attribute. If \"materialName\" is not defined, then \"dest\" directory is used. Non alphanumeric characters are replaced with underscores (\"_\").\n121\n\n\nGO_MATERIAL_HAS_CHANGED\nA boolean value indicating if the material revision has changed since the previous run (when using only one material)\ntrue\n\n\nGO_MATERIAL_${material name or dest}_HAS_CHANGED\nWhen more than one material is configured for your pipeline, a flag would be available for each of the materials available to denote if the corresponding material's revision has changed since the previous run. The environment variable is named with the material's \"materialName\" attribute. If \"materialName\" is not defined, then \"dest\" directory is used. Non alphanumeric characters are replaced with underscores (\"_\").\nfalse\n\n\n\nUse current revision in a build\nIt is often useful to use the current version control revision number in your build. For example, you might want to use the svn version number in the name of your binary for tracing purposes. GoCD makes much of this information available to your build scripts as environment variables.\nExample usages\nOne material\nFor this example, we are going to assume we are using a single Subversion repository for our source control system and we have a job set up to call the ant target \"dist\".\n\nAdd the following target to your ant build.xml\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\nNow, when GoCD runs the 'my-app' pipeline on revision 123, the file deploy-123.txt will be created, with the following content:\n\ndeploy-123.txt\n\nBuilding pipeline my-app\nMultiple materials\nFor this example we are going to assume we are using a Subversion repository containing\nthe code and a Mercurial repository containing configuration scripts.\n\nEnsure the pipeline materials look like this\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n  \n  ...\n\n\n\nAdd the following target to your ant build.xml\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\nNow, when GoCD runs the 'my-app' pipeline with the code at revision '123' and the configuration at revision '59cab75ccf231b9e338c96cff0f4adad5cb7d335', the file deploy-123.txt will be created with the following content:\n\ndeploy-123.txt\n\nBuilding pipeline my-app\nConfiguration version: 59cab75ccf231b9e338c96cff0f4adad5cb7d335\nPass environment variables to a job\nYou can specify variables for Environments, Pipelines, Stages and Jobs. If a variable is specified more than once, the\nmost specific scope is used.

For example, code and tests are checked in as part of the same commit. But code is built and tested in sequence, so the same material version has to be used for pipelines that build and test your code. This section covers some Dependency Management concepts and how GoCD handles certain complex scenarios.\nPropagate material revision throughout the dependency chain\nIf you have frequent material updates coupled with long running dependent pipelines sharing that same material, you may encounter situations where the revision that triggered the dependency chain is no longer the latest revision. Go keeps track of what revision triggered a dependency chain and ensures that the same version propagates throughout all members of that chain. This helps ensure that all artifacts generated as part of that build share a common revision.\nExample\nConsider the following dependency chain:\n\nLegend\n\nSCM : Repository\nrev1, rev2 : Check-ins to the repository\nA : Pipeline for development build\ndependent B : Pipeline for acceptance tests\n\nHow it works\n\nCode is checked in to SCM (rev1)\nDevelopment build (A) is triggered by the check-in\nThere is another check-in to SCM (rev2)\nDevelopment build completes (with rev1) and triggers acceptance tests (B)\nHere's where dependency management comes in. Go is smart enough detect that rev1 originally triggered the build and ensures that the acceptance tests check-out that revision (rev1) and not the latest revision (rev2). In this situation, Go ensures that the appropriate version of acceptance tests are run against the appropriate version of the development build.\n\n"},"faq/rm_what_is_deployed.html":{"url":"faq/rm_what_is_deployed.html","title":"Check What's Deployed","summary":"Before deploying something into production on GoCD, it's useful to understand what is currently there.","keywords":"","body":"Discover what's in an GoCD environment\nBefore deploying something into production, it is often useful to know what is currently there.\nExample usage\nFor this example, we will assume we have a stage name \"production\" that will automatically deploy a binary onto a production server\n\nStart at the Environments page\n\n\n\nClick on the name of your \"production\" stage\n\n\n\nThe Stage Details page will show every time GoCD has deployed your application\n\n\n"},"faq/deploy_a_specific_build_to_an_environment.html":{"url":"faq/deploy_a_specific_build_to_an_environment.html","title":"Deploy a Specific Build","summary":"Deploy specific revisions of the materials to an environment using GoCD","keywords":"","body":"Deploy specific revisions of the materials to an environment\nGoCD allows you to hand pick which revision of your materials you would like to deploy to your environment. This is a a very common requirement on larger projects which have multiple materials in their deployment pipeline. Sometimes you may wish to have control over which revision of the application is deployed to a particular environment (say UAT).\nSelect specific revisions of materials to deploy\nConsider the case where a deployment pipeline 'deploy_bookstore' has 2 materials - Material 'svn' and upstream pipeline 'bookstore'. It is very common to know that label, say \"3.4-RELEASE\" of the dependent pipeline 'bookstore' is stable. All the changes that you want right now in your UAT environment are made to material 'svn'. In such a scenario when you deploy \"deploy_bookstore\" to UAT, you might always want to select label \"3.4-RELEASE\" of pipeline 'bookstore' and the latest (or a known revision specified by your developer) of material 'svn'.\nOnce there are any new changes to any of the materials, Go will indicate to the user that newer revisions are available to deploy. You could use this information and deploy a custom build with hand picked revision or deploy the latest available revision.\nSteps to select the revisions of materials you want to deploy\n\nNavigate to the Environments page and locate the specific deployment pipeline you are interested in.\nClick on \"Deploy Specific Revision\".\n\n\n\nThis gives you the list of available revisions for each material\nClick on the \"Revision to Deploy\" search box.

By default, polling occurs every minute and ten materials at a time. The polling interval and the number of materials to be polled simultaneously are configurable.\nGoCD uses SCM commands to poll for changes. For example, to check for any new changes in SVN repository the following command is used:\nsvn log --non-interactive --xml -v -r HEAD:'revision' 'repository-URL'\n\nThe SCM command used by GoCD server can hang with no output. Invalid configuration, network issues, console input block are some of the causes for such a situation. Such scenarios cause pipeline scheduling delays and also lead to performance degradation\nSuch a scenario is notified to the users by a warning in Server Health; when clicked shows a message similar to the one below.\n\nWhat can I do with the information\nWhen you see warning messages like the one above\n\nIdentify the processes running as children of GoCD Server\n\nOn Windows, you can use tools like Process Explorer .

If it is, then any agent that can pick up a job from that pipeline\nneeds to be a part of that environment as well.\n\n\n\nMac OS X - Message related to Java 1.7\nIf you were greeted with a message such as this, when trying to use GoCD on Mac OSX:\n\n  \n\n\nyou might have a Java installation in either a non-standard location or older\nthan Java 1.7. The GoCD Mac application tries to find the correct Java\ninstallation to use, using this command:\n/usr/libexec/java_home -v \"1.7+\"\nIf that fails, then you see the message shown above.\nIn case you are sure that you have Java 1.7 or newer installed, and the\napplication cannot find it at all, then the application can be forced to use a\nJava installation of your choosing, using the GO_JAVA_HOME environment\nvariable. Suppose the Go Server.app file is in /Applications, and the Java\ninstallation you want GoCD to use is at: /Library/MY_Java/Contents/Home,\nthen you can start the GoCD Server with that Java using this (in a terminal\nemulator):\nGO_JAVA_HOME=\"/Library/MY_Java/Contents/Home\" open \"/Applications/Go Server.app\"\nPlease note that this is used to set the Java home, and not the path to the\njava executable. Usually, GO_JAVA_HOME/bin/java will need to be a working\nJava 1.7+ executable.\n\n  figure.small_image img { width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; }\n\n\n\nIncompatible java version while upgrading to 17.x version\nJava 7 support is removed as part of 17.1 release.\nThis implies an existing installation of GoCD will stop working after an upgrade\nif it is configured to run with Java 7.\nIn such cases, one of the following error messages would be seen in the logs:\nUnrecognized VM option \"MaxMetaSpaceSize=256m\"\nor\nUnsupported major.minor version 52.0\nOn Windows:\nThis error will be logged, in /go-server-wrapper.log on server and\n/go-agent-bootstrapper-wrapper.log on agent, if startup failed due to incompatible version of Java.\nResolution: Update the environment variable GO_SERVER_JAVA_HOME, GO_AGENT_JAVA_HOME\nto the Java 8 path and restart the GoCD server/agent.\nOn Linux:\nThis error will be logged, in /go-server.out.log on server and\n/go-agent-bootstrapper.log on agent, if startup failed due to incompatible version of Java.\nResolution: Update the environment variable JAVA_HOME set in /etc/default/go-server, /etc/default/go-agent\nto Java 8 path, and restart the GoCD server/agent.\n\nGoCD SPA Pages - There was an unknown error performing the operation. Possible reason (timeout)\nThe GoCD SPA page periodically makes AJAX API calls to fetch the current state of the entity and refreshes the page, this is done to ensure the information on the page is not stale.\nThe AJAX API request has a timeout set to 5000 milliseconds, if the server does not respond within that duration the request is cancelled and an error is shown on the page.  \n\n  \n\n\nResolution: If this is happening, consider increase the timeout period by specifying the go.spa.timeout\n"},"faq/dev_use_current_revision_in_build.html":{"url":"faq/dev_use_current_revision_in_build.html","title":"Ignore this","summary":"Using environment variables in GoCD","keywords":"","body":"Using Environment Variables in GoCD\nAccessing environment variables in tasks\nEvery task in GoCD is provided with a set of environment variables, as a part of the context, when it is run. Depending\non the kind of process used in the task, environment variables are accessed differently. Presented below are some common\nusage scenarios, with the assumption that a job has been configured with an environment variable called ENV_VAR_1,\nwith the value VALUE_1.\n1. Using an environment variable in a custom command on Unix/Linux\nA very common use case for environment variables is to use them as arguments for a custom command\n(\"exec task\" in GoCD). Assuming\nthat you want to pass the environment variable ENV_VAR_1 to the ls command, you might be tempted to try something\nlike this:\n\n  \n  Figure 1: Wrong usage of environment variable in custom command task (Will not work)\n\n\nWhen run, it will end with a message like this:\n\n  \n  Figure 2: Result of wrong usage of environment variable in custom command task\n\n\nAs you can see, the environment variable, $ENV_VAR_1 was passed in literally to the command ls and was not\ninterpolated. What is happening here is that GoCD is directly executing the command and passing in the parameters,\nwithout involving a shell like bash or sh in the middle. When a command such as ls $ENV_VAR_1 is executed from the\ncommand-line, the shell process is the one that interpolates the environment variable and replaces it with its value, so\nthat the ls command does not see it.\nSo, we need to do the same here. The correct way to invoke this, so that the interpolation of the environment variable\nworks is like this:\n\n  \n  Figure 3: Correct usage of environment variable in custom command task\n\n\nWhen run, it will end with a message like this:\n\n  \n  Figure 4: Result of correct usage of environment variable in custom command task\n\n\nEven though the command failed in this example, the value of the environment variable was interpolated. You can replace\nls with some other command, but the concept remains the same.\n2. Using an environment variable in a custom command on Windows\nThis is easier than using it in a shell script because, on Windows GoCD agents, commands are executed by wrapping them\nin cmd /c. So, environment variables get interpolated automatically. So, with a configuration such as this:\n\n  \n  Figure 5: Usage of environment variable on Windows\n\n\nWhen run, it will end with a message like this:\n\n  \n  Figure 8: Result of usage of environment variable on Windows\n\n\nSimilarly, it works when used in a batch file (say, \"env_var.cmd\"), with content such as this:\necho Environment variable ENV_VAR_1 is: %ENV_VAR_1%\nNotice that, unlike on Unix/Linux, the way to access an environment variable on Windows is to use %, instead of $.\n3. Using an environment variable in a shell-script - On Unix/Linux\nUsing an environment variable inside a shell-script is not special at all. You can directly use it, as you would any\nenvironment variable. For instance, a shell-script with this content, will work when executed normally:\n#!/bin/sh\n\necho \"Value of environment variable ENV_VAR_1 is: $ENV_VAR_1\"\nThis works when executed directly, with a config such as this:\n\n  \n  Figure 9: Usage of environment variable in a shell-script\n\n\nWhen run, it will end with a message like this:\n\n  \n  Figure 10: Result of usage of environment variable in a shell-script\n\n\n\n4. Using an environment variable in a ruby script\nAgain, using an environment variable inside a ruby script is not special at all. This has been mentioned here, just to\nshow that scripts written in different languages have to use different mechanisms to access environment variables. A\nruby script such as this works as expected:\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby\n\nputs \"Environment variable ENV_VAR_1 has the value: #{ENV['ENV_VAR_1']}\"\nStandard GoCD environment variables\nThe examples above mention a custom environment variable set at the job level. However, there are some standard\nenvironment variables available during every job run, set by GoCD. They are:\n\n\n\nEnvironment Variable\nDescription\nExample contents\n\n\n\n\nGO_SERVER_URL\nBase URL for the GoCD server (including the context root)\nhttps://127.0.0.1:8154/go\n\n\nGO_ENVIRONMENT_NAME\nThe name of the current environment. This is only set if the environment is specified. Otherwise the variable is not set.\nDevelopment\n\n\nGO_PIPELINE_NAME\nName of the current pipeline being run\nmain\n\n\nGO_PIPELINE_COUNTER\nHow many times the current pipeline has been run.\n2345\n\n\nGO_PIPELINE_LABEL\nLabel for the current pipeline. By default, this is set to the pipeline count (this can be set to a custom pipeline label)\n1.1.2345\n\n\nGO_STAGE_NAME\nName of the current stage being run\ndev\n\n\nGO_STAGE_COUNTER\nHow many times the current stage has been run\n1\n\n\nGO_JOB_NAME\nName of the current job being run\nlinux-firefox\n\n\nGO_TRIGGER_USER\nUsername of the user that triggered the build. This will have one of three possible valuesanonymous - if there is no securityusername of the user, who triggered the buildchanges, if SCM changes auto-triggered the buildtimer, if the pipeline is triggered at a scheduled time\nchanges\n\n\nGO_DEPENDENCY_LABEL_${pipeline name}\nThe label of the upstream pipeline (when using dependent pipelines)\n1.0.3456\n\n\nGO_DEPENDENCY_LOCATOR_${pipeline name}\nThe locator of the upstream pipeline (when using dependent pipelines), which can be used to create the URL for RESTful API calls\nupstream/1.0.3456/dev/1\n\n\nGO_REVISION\nThe current source control revision being run (when using only one material)\n123\n\n\nGO_REVISION_${material name or dest}\nIf you are using more than one material in your pipeline, the revision for each material is available. The environment variable is named with the material's \"materialName\" attribute. If \"materialName\" is not defined, then \"dest\" directory is used. Non alphanumeric characters are replaced with underscores (\"_\").\n123\n\n\nGO_TO_REVISION\nIf the pipeline was triggered with a series of source control revisions(say 121 to 123), then this environment variable has the value of the latest revision (when using only one material). This is always same as GO_REVISION.\n123\n\n\nGO_TO_REVISION_${material name or dest}\nIf you are using more than one material in your pipeline, the 'to' revision for each material is available. The environment variable is named with the material's \"materialName\" attribute. If \"materialName\" is not defined, then \"dest\" directory is used. Non alphanumeric characters are replaced with underscores (\"_\").\n123\n\n\nGO_FROM_REVISION\nIf the pipeline was triggered with a series of source control revisions(say 121 to 123), then this environment variable has the value of the oldest revision (when using only one material)\n121\n\n\nGO_FROM_REVISION_${material name or dest}\nIf you are using more than one material in your pipeline, the 'from' revision for each material is available. The environment variable is named with the material's \"materialName\" attribute. If \"materialName\" is not defined, then \"dest\" directory is used. Non alphanumeric characters are replaced with underscores (\"_\").\n121\n\n\nGO_MATERIAL_HAS_CHANGED\nA boolean value indicating if the material revision has changed since the previous run (when using only one material)\ntrue\n\n\nGO_MATERIAL_${material name or dest}_HAS_CHANGED\nWhen more than one material is configured for your pipeline, a flag would be available for each of the materials available to denote if the corresponding material's revision has changed since the previous run. The environment variable is named with the material's \"materialName\" attribute. If \"materialName\" is not defined, then \"dest\" directory is used. Non alphanumeric characters are replaced with underscores (\"_\").\nfalse\n\n\n\nUse current revision in a build\nIt is often useful to use the current version control revision number in your build. For example, you might want to use the svn version number in the name of your binary for tracing purposes. GoCD makes much of this information available to your build scripts as environment variables.\nExample usages\nOne material\nFor this example, we are going to assume we are using a single Subversion repository for our source control system and we have a job set up to call the ant target \"dist\".\n\nAdd the following target to your ant build.xml\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\nNow, when GoCD runs the 'my-app' pipeline on revision 123, the file deploy-123.txt will be created, with the following content:\n\ndeploy-123.txt\n\nBuilding pipeline my-app\nMultiple materials\nFor this example we are going to assume we are using a Subversion repository containing\nthe code and a Mercurial repository containing configuration scripts.\n\nEnsure the pipeline materials look like this\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n  \n  ...\n\n\n\nAdd the following target to your ant build.xml\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\nNow, when GoCD runs the 'my-app' pipeline with the code at revision '123' and the configuration at revision '59cab75ccf231b9e338c96cff0f4adad5cb7d335', the file deploy-123.txt will be created with the following content:\n\ndeploy-123.txt\n\nBuilding pipeline my-app\nConfiguration version: 59cab75ccf231b9e338c96cff0f4adad5cb7d335\nPass environment variables to a job\nYou can specify variables for Environments, Pipelines, Stages and Jobs. If a variable is specified more than once, the\nmost specific scope is used. For example if you specify variable FOO='foo' for an environment, and FOO='bar' for a Job,\nthen the variable will have the value 'bar' when the job runs.\nSetting variables on an environment\nYou can add variables to an environment by editing the configuration of the environment. Click on the name of the environment to edit configuration.\n\nYou specify variables on an environment in the Config XML by adding an  section to the environment definition.\n\n    \n        \n            bar\n        \n        \n            Variable values can have\n            multiple lines (assuming that your operating system supports this correctly).\n            \n        \n        \n            ]]>\n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n\nYou can add variables for a job by editing the job configuration.\n\nYou specify variables on an job in the Config XML by adding an  section to the job definition.\n\n    \n       \n            bar\n        \n        \n            Variable values can have\n            multiple lines (assuming that your operating system supports this correctly).\n            \n        \n        \n            ]]>\n            \n        \n    \n    ...\n\n\n"}}}
