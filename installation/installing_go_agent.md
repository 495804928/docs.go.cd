# Installing GoCD agent

You need to deploy at least one GoCD agent before you can build with GoCD. For the very simplest installation, you can run a GoCD agent on the same machine as your GoCD server.

Before you install the GoCD server or agent, please ensure that you meet the [System Requirements](system_requirements.md).

# Choose your operating system

- [Linux](install/agent/linux.md)
- [Windows](install/agent/windows.md)
- [Mac OS X](install/agent/osx.md)
- [Generic Zip](install/agent/zip.md)
