# 5.2.2 Database Management

Go uses [H2 Database](http://www.h2database.com/) as its choice of data store. In Go, H2 operates in an embedded mode, loaded into Go's JVM. As of the time this document was written, the H2 version in use was 1.3.168.

## Schema

The database schema is primed as part of the database migration scripts that run during startup. An overview of the database schema is shown below
